# Lyrics_classifier:
Web scraping, database creation, training and prediction

## Introduction:

Web scraping, is data scraping used for extracting data from websites using its HTML structure.
In this project, I used BeautifulSoup python package in order to automatically extract all lyrics from artists
at [https://metrolyrics.com](https://metrolyrics.com), to then build an artist's classifier to predict the
artist on new text. The program works in three modes: The scraping mode, the training mode and the prediction mode
which are described in the next sections.
