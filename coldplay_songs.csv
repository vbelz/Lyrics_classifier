One minute I held the key Next the walls were closed on me And I discovered that my castle stands Upon pillars of salt, and pillars of sand.

I hear Jerusalem bells were ringing Roman Cavalry choirs were singing Be my mirror, my sword and shield My missionaries in a foreign field For some reason I can't explain I know St. Peter won't call my name Never an honest word But that was when I ruled the world.
