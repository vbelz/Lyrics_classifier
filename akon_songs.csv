I try hard.. but I guess I have to try harder......... I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery Man I try so hard always being a victum of these streets Anit my fault cause I try to get away but trouble follows me... And still I try so hard.. hoping one day you'll come and rescue me..... But until then... I'll be posted up here rain, sleet, hail snow... Until then... I'll be posted up right here with my heat getting dough.... First let me explain I'm just a black man... And I come from the darkside... So I'm having a hard time staying on track man.. My mind be racing.. and I don't even know what I'm chasing Yet I've been I and out of relationships I'm starting to see it's me where the complication's at But I'm laying back... praying that you get that peice of mind of me I thought I was right but really I'm wrong Then again I was blind to see I was in a fast lane chasing my dream.. And then it seem when the fame and cash came they just go me... Going craazzzyyyy lately I been so faded trying to earse it But I can't cause the drama just grows greater And I've been in so many collisins by putting S*** off till later.... I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery Man I try so hard always being a victum of these streets Anit my fault cause I try to get away but trouble follows me... And still I try so hard.. hoping one day you'll come and rescue me..... But until then... I'll be posted up here rain, sleet, hail snow... Until then... I'll be posted up right here with my heat getting dough.... It's like I'm taking steps 5 forward and 10 steps back Tryin to get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track And I keep runnin away from the ones that say they love me the most How can I create a distance when it's suppose to be close and uh.. I just don't know..but I'll be out here fighting demons and it's like a curse.. That I can't shake this part of cleveland and... Lord will you help me...to stop this pain I keep inflicting on my family.... Hustling and gambling drinkin and scramblin And losing sight of what I'm suppose to be handling It's hard to manage cause every day is a challenge.... And man I'm slippin can't lose my balance tryin not to panic.... I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery Man I try so hard always being a victum of these streets Anit my fault cause I try to get away but trouble follows me... And still I try so hard.. hoping one day you'll come and rescue me..... But until then... I'll be posted up here rain, sleet, hail snow... Until then... I'll be posted up right here with my heat getting dough.... I see the things won't change I'm stuck in the game.. As soon as I get out it keeps pullin me back, man Got me doin dirty dirt so used to hustling money... That I don't understand no 9 to 5 work.... Studied on these streets hustlers know what I mean... Thugsters ballin before us..I'm trying to make the major league So we never leave never till the sun came up.......... Gotta get it. can't leave it, no grudge...... Today games they play gotta go hard to get what you out in.. If you fall then it's all on you..... gotta watch what you sign too... Try so hard I won't play the fool. I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery Man I try so hard always being a victum of these streets Anit my fault cause I try to get away but trouble follows me... And still I try so hard.. hoping one day you'll come and rescue me..... But until then... I'll be posted up here rain, sleet, hail snow... Until then... I'll be posted up right here with my heat getting dough.... Thank to Alejandra for writing these lyrics!!!",3691,en,

Cause I was raised up to show no fear Cowardly hearts'll never last long here If you ain't man enough to make shit clear Guaranteed you'll get blown away Cause I done seen the block break down tears And I done seen the cops break my peers Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years Tryin' not to get blown away. Keep my eye out for jakes Ears to the streets Other eye out for snakes And these scandalous freaks If we ain't on good terms Don't bother to speak Don't smile and try to spark a convo with me Same thing'll make ya laugh it'll make ya cry This quiet nigga, he'll take ya life Hate for it to be the world's sacrifice If somebody else could travel Through the tunnel of life Cause I'm that type of guy I'll be there When you're ridin' But I'll stay to myself So if you see me out there with a bear we fightin' Then nigga go help the bear. Cause I was raised up to show no fear Cowardly hearts'll never last long here If you ain't man enough to make shit clear Guaranteed you'll get blown away Cause I done seen the block break down tears And I done seen the cops break my peers Tryin' to hold on to a couple more years Tryin' not to get blown away",3105,en,

Everybody longs for success, whatever that is The whole world's longing for each his own It's a place where the truth stays in the light Cause nobody ever lies And we follow our hearts into the night Wake up thankful to be alive You can't try to save a life that don't want to be saved If we all see eye to eye the whole world would be grey. So let's keep running to each his own If we all keep running then we can toast To each his own And we'll be alright We'll be alright Alright. I am who I am And you are who you are I could wish on a cloud And you could wish on a star Still we'll be alright.

It's like I'm taking steps 5 forward and 10 steps back Tryin to get ahead of the game but I can't seem to get it on track And I keep runnin away from the ones that say they love me the most How can I create a distance when it's suppose to be close and uh.. I just don't know..but I'll be out here fighting demons and it's like a curse.. That I can't shake this part of cleveland and... Lord will you help me...to stop this pain I keep inflicting on my family.... Hustling and gambling drinkin and scramblin And losing sight of what I'm suppose to be handling It's hard to manage cause every day is a challenge.... And man I'm slippin can't lose my balance tryin not to panic.... I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery Man I try so hard always being a victum of these streets Anit my fault cause I try to get away but trouble follows me... And still I try so hard.. hoping one day you'll come and rescue me..... But until then... I'll be posted up here rain, sleet, hail snow... Until then... I'll be posted up right here with my heat getting dough.... I see the things won't change I'm stuck in the game.. As soon as I get out it keeps pullin me back, man Got me doin dirty dirt so used to hustling money... That I don't understand no 9 to 5 work.... Studied on these streets hustlers know what I mean... Thugsters ballin before us..I'm trying to make the major league So we never leave never till the sun came up.......... Gotta get it. can't leave it, no grudge...... Today games they play gotta go hard to get what you out in.. If you fall then it's all on you..... gotta watch what you sign too... Try so hard I won't play the fool. I try so hard can't seem to get away from misery Man I try so hard always being a victum of these streets Anit my fault cause I try to get away but trouble follows me... And still I try so hard.. hoping one day you'll come and rescue me..... But until then... I'll be posted up here rain, sleet, hail snow... Until then... I'll be posted up right here with my heat getting dough.... Thank to Alejandra for writing these lyrics!!!",3691,en,

I'm Sorry,https://www.metrolyrics.com/im-sorry-lyrics-akon.html,akon,As life goes on I'm starting to learn more and more about responsibility And I realize everything I do is affecting the people around me So I want to take this time out to apologize for things that I've done And things that haven't occurred yet And things that they don't want to take responsibility for. I'm sorry for the times that I left you home I was on the road and you were alone I'm sorry for the times that I had to go I'm sorry for the fact that I did not know. That you were sitting home just wishing we Could go back to when it was just you and me I'm sorry for the times I would neglect I'm sorry for the times I disrespect. I'm sorry for the wrong things that I've done I'm sorry I'm not always there for my sons I'm sorry for the fact that I am not aware That you can't sleep at night when I am not there. Because I'm in the streets like every day I'm sorry for the things that I did not say Like how you are the best thing in my world And how I am so proud to call you my girl. I understand that there are some problems And I am not too blind to know All the pain you kept inside you Even though you might not show. If I can't apologize for being wrong Then it's just a shame on me I'll be the reason for your pain And you can put the blame on me. You can put the blame on me You can put the blame on me You can put the blame on me You can put the blame on me. Said you can put the blame on me Said you can put the blame on me Said you can put the blame on me You can put the blame on me. I'm sorry for the things that he put you through And all the times you didn't know what to do I'm sorry that you had to go and sell those bags Just trying to stay busy till you heard from dad. When you would rather be home with all your kids As one big family with love and bliss And even though pops treated us like kings He got a second wife and you didn't agree. He got up and left you there all alone I'm sorry that you had to do it on your own I'm sorry that I went and added to your grief I'm sorry that your son was once a thief. I'm sorry that I grew up way too fast I wish I would've listened and not be so bad I'm sorry that your life turned out this way I'm sorry that the Feds came and took me away. I understand that there are some problems And I am not too blind to know All the pain you kept inside you Even though you might not show. If I can't apologize for being wrong Then it's just a shame on me I'll be the reason for your pain And you can put the blame on me. You can put the blame on me You can put the blame on me You can put the blame on me You can put the blame on me. Said you can put the blame on me Said you can put the blame on me Said you can put the blame on me You can put the blame on me. I'm sorry that it took so long to see They were dead wrong trying to put it on me I'm sorry that it took so long to speak But I was on tour with Gwen Stefani. I'm sorry for the hand that she was dealt For the embarrassment that she felt Just a little young girl trying to have fun Her daddy shouldn't never let her out that young. I'm sorry for Club Zen getting shut down I hope they manage better next time around How was I to know she was underage? In a 21 and older club they say. Why doesn't anybody wanna take blame? Verizon backed out disgracing my name I'm just a singer trying to entertain Because I love my fans I'll take that blame. Even though the blame's on you Even though the blame's on you Even though the blame's on you I'll take that blame from you. And you can put that blame on me And you can put that blame on me You can put that blame on me And you can put that blame on me. And you can put that blame on me And you can put that blame on me,3689,en,

What about that day you said I wouldn't amount to shit And about that day you kicked me out onto the bricks What about that time you said I wouldn't make a dime And about that time you said I couldn't make you mine. Destination to the bank overseas Where Akon's treated like royalty 'Cause there's so much in this world that I have to see The wagon's rolling jump on it and follow me. Born and raised in Africa trying to make a scene (Trying to make a scene) The best way to get to you is by this music thing And you might believe. Akon, c'mon.

And did she ever think I'm good enough for her? Despite my suffering I felt the loving And she was there when I needed her the most. And that's the sign that I received from up above Letting me know that everything would be okay And she was that someone that pulled me out of the mud And also was the one that said to me.

I don't care if they're borrowing from rock bands of yesterday because all bands do that. Deer Tick really does lay it all out there and with more energy than most. Their shows are unpredictable and wild at times (I saw McCauley light a set list on fire) and I feel like there are so few bands keeping that crazy part of rock 'n' roll alive. They're one of those bands that's more than the sum of their recorded songs.
