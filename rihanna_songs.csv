Stay,https://www.metrolyrics.com/stay-lyrics-rihanna.html,rihanna,"All along it was a fever A cold sweat, hot headed believer I threw my hands in the air I said show me something He said, ""If you dare come a little closer"". Round and around and around and around we go Oh, now tell me, now tell me, now tell me now you know. Not really sure how to feel about it Something in the way you move Makes me feel like I can't live without you It takes me all the way. I want you to stay. It's not much of a life you're living It's not just something you take, it's given. Round and around, and around, and around we go Oh, now tell me, now tell me, now tell me, now you know. Not really sure how to feel about it Something in the way you move Makes me feel like I can't live without you It takes me all the way I want you to stay. Oh, the reason I hold on Oh, 'cause I need this hole gone. Funny you're the broken one But I'm the only one who needed saving 'Cause when you never see the light It's hard to know which one of us is caving. Not really sure how to feel about it Something in the way you move Makes me feel like I can't live without you It takes me all the way I want you to stay, stay I want you to stay, oh",1146,en,

Amazing they ungrateful after all the game I gave away Safe to say, I paved the way for you cats to get paid today You still be wastin' days away now had I never saved the day. Consider them my protÃ©gÃ©, homage I think they should pay Instead of being gracious, they violate in a major way I never been a hater, still I love 'em in a crazy way Some say they sold the yay, and no, they couldn't get work on Labor Day. It ain't that black or white, it has an area the shade of gray. I'm West Side anyway, even if I left today and stayed away. Some move away to make a way, not move away 'cause they afraid I brought back to the hood, and all you ever did was take away I pray for patience but they make me wanna melt they face away Like I once made 'em spray, now I could make them put the K's away. Been thuggin' all my life, can't say I don't deserve to take a break You rather see me catch a case, then watch my future fade away. You're gonna be a shining star With fancy clothes and fancy cars. And then you see, you're gonna go far 'Cause everyone knows who you are So live your life (Hey) Ay-ay-ay. You steady chasin' that paper Just live your life (Oh) Ay-ay-ay.

Seems as though you lost sight of what's important when depositin' Them checks into ya bank account, and you've up out of poverty Your values is in disarrayed, prioritizin' horribly Unhappy with the riches 'cause you're piss-poor morally Ignorin' all prior advice and forewarnin' And we mighty full of ourselves all of a sudden, aren't we?

Love The Way You Lie Part II,https://www.metrolyrics.com/love-the-way-you-lie-part-ii-lyrics-rihanna.html,rihanna,"On the first page of our story The future seemed so bright Then this thing turned out so evil I don't know why I'm still surprised Even angels have their wicked schemes And you take that to new extremes But you'll always be my hero Even though you've lost your mind. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Oh, I love the way you lie. Now there's gravel in our voices Glass is shattered from the fight In this tug of war you'll always win Even when I'm right 'Cause you feed me fables from your hand With violent words and empty threats And it's sick that all these battles Are what keeps me satisfied. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Oh, I love the way you lie. So maybe I'm a masochist I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave 'Til the walls are goin' up In smoke with all our memories. It's morning, you wake, a sun ray hits your face Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry That you pushed me into the coffee table last night So I can push you off me Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy Baby, without you I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths but we Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs That we'll have each other's backs, 'cause we're that lucky Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills You hit me twice, yeah, but who's countin'? I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refuse counsellin' This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it 'Cause with you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you I'm out it. Just gonna stand there and watch me burn But that's all right because I like the way it hurts Just gonna stand there and hear me cry But that's all right because I love the way you lie I love the way you lie Oh, I love the way you lie.

Prototype,https://www.metrolyrics.com/prototype-lyrics-rihanna.html,rihanna,"Just a thought To add suspense To all the games Of discontent.. Fear is real But not self-taught You let others Be the cause.. There we go racing towards the sun, Ignoring all the noise, Striving for the grace of man. People play this great charade, And always miss the point. Never fall for prophecies.. You say it draws near, That it will be clear. You act so convinced, A fortress you've built. Remember the doubt By which I now stand. You write the book On the way it all ends.. Tear down Those mighty walls. Reinvent The way you talk.. Look ahead, Now down below, Or high above, Where angels flow.. There we go racing towards the sun, Ignoring all the noise, Striving for the grace of man. People play this great charade, And always miss the point. Never fall for prophecies.. Waiting to see Our kind disagree. You draw the line And stick to your pride. Remember the doubt By which I now stand. You write the book On the way.... It ends.. (Guitar solos). You say it draws near That it will be clear. You act so convinced, A fortress you've built. Remember the doubt By which I now stand. You wrote the book On the way it all ends.. It ends.",1145,en,

Feel like a brand new person (But you make the same old mistakes) I finally know what is love (You don't have what it takes). Stop before it's not too late I know there's too much at stake Making the same mistakes. And I still don't know why it's happening (Stop while it's not too late) And I still don't know. Finally taking flight I know you don't think it's right I know that you think it's fake Maybe fake's what I like. The point is I have the right I'm thinking in black and white I'm thinking it's worth the fight Soon to be out of sight. Knowing it all this time Going with what I always longed for.
