Rap God,https://www.metrolyrics.com/rap-god-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Look, I was gonna go easy on you not to hurt your feelings But I'm only going to get this one chance Something's wrong, I can feel it (For six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on) Just a feeling I've got, like something's about to happen but I don't know what If that means what I think it means, we're in trouble, big trouble And if he is as bananas as you say, I'm not taking any chances (You are just what the doc ordered). I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box. They said I rap like a robot, so call me rap-bot. But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes. I got a laptop in my back pocket. My pen'll go off when I half-cock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a livin' and a killin' off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his, nutsack I'm an MC still as honest But as rude and as indecent as all hell Syllables, skill-a-holic (Kill 'em all with) This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match with this rappity-rap Packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac' Backpack rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while I'm practicing that I'll still be able to break a motha-fuckin' table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs. Feel my wrath of attack. Rappers are having a rough time period, here's a maxi pad. It's actually disastrously bad for the wack. While I'm masterfully constructing this master piece (yeah). Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box. Let me show you maintaining this shit ain't that hard, that hard Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got Well, to be truthful the blueprint's Simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the earth like an asteroid Did nothing but shoot for the moon since (Pew) MC's get taken to school with this music Cause I use it as a vehicle to ""bus the rhyme"" Now I lead a new school full of students Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac N.W.A, Cube, hey, Doc, Ren, Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up Blow up and be in a position To meet Run-D.M.C And induct them into the mothafuckin' Rock 'n Roll Hall of Fame Even though I'll walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the alcohol of fame. On the wall of (shame). You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames. Off a plank and. Tell me what in the fuck are you thinking?. Little gay-lookin boy. So gay I can barely say it with a 'straight' face, lookin' boy You're witnessing a mass-occur Like you're watching a church gathering take place, looking boy. Oy vey, that boy's gay, that's all they say, looking boy. You get a thumbs up, pat on the back. And a ""way to go"" from your label every day, looking boy. Hey, looking boy, what you say, looking boy I get a ""hell yeah"" from Dre, looking boy. I'ma work for. Everything I have, never ask nobody for shit Get outta my face, looking boy Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable of keeping up. With the same pace, looking boy. Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a Rap God, Rap God. All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod. The way I'm racing around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God Kneel before General Zod this planet's Krypton No Asgard, Asgard So you be Thor and I'll be Odin, you rodent, I'm omnipotent Let off then I'm reloading immediately with these bombs I'm toting And I should not be woken I'm the walking dead But I'm just a talking head, a zombie floating But I got your mom deep throating I'm out my Ramen Noodle We have nothing in common, poodle I'm a doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil It's me My honesty's brutal But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere In this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle Enough rhymes to Maybe try to help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines Just in case cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime I know there was a time where once I, was king of the underground But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come trying to censor you like that one line I said on ""I'm Back"" from the Mathers LP 1 When I tried to say ""I'll take seven kids from Columbine Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine"" See if I get away with it now that I ain't as big as I was but I'm Morphin' into an immortal Coming through the portal You're stuck in a time warp from 2004, though And I don't know what the fuck that you rhyme for You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking Cornrows You write normal? Fuck being normal And I just bought a new raygun from the future Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabolous made Ray J mad Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad Singing to a man while they played piano Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station The very next day, ""Hey Fab, I'ma kill you!"" Lyrics coming at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad) Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assuming I'm a human What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman Innovative and I'm made of rubber So that anything you say is ricocheting off of me and it'll glue to you and I'm devastating, more than ever demonstrating How to give a mothafuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating Never fading, and I know the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebrating Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated I make elevating music, you make elevator music ""Oh, he's too mainstream"" Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it ""It's not hip-hop, it's pop"" Cause I found a, hella way to fuse it With rock, shock rap with Doc Throw on ""Lose Yourself"" and make 'em lose it ""I don't know how to make songs like that I don't know what words to use"" Let me know when it occurs to you While I'm ripping any one of these verses that versus you It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurting you How many verses I gotta murder to Prove that if you were half as nice Your songs you could sacrifice virgins too? Ungh, school flunky, pill junkie But look at the accolades, these skills brung me Full of myself, but still hungry I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to And I'm a million leagues above you Ill when I speak in tongues But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel I'm asleep in the front seat Bumping Heavy D and the Boyz Still ""Chunky but Funky"" But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils and here's what they want from me They're asking me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic To the situation and understand the discrimination But fuck it Life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then But if I can't batter the women How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then? Don't mistake him for Satan It's a fatal mistake If you think I need to be overseas and take a vacation To trip abroad And make her fall on her face and don't be a retard Be a king? Think not Why be a king when you can be a God?",7932,en,

Will the real Slim Shady please stand up? I repeat, will the real Slim Shady please stand up? We're gonna have a problem here... Y'all act like you never seen a white person before Jaws all on the floor like Pam and Tommy just burst in the door And started whooping her ass worse than before They first were divorced, throwing her over furniture (Ah!) It's the return of the... ""Ah, wait, no way, you're kidding, He didn't just say what I think he did, did he?"" And Dr. Dre said... nothing, you idiots! Dr. Dre's dead, he's locked in my basement!

""Yeah, but he's so cute though!"" Yeah, I probably got a couple of screws up in my head loose But no worse, than what's going on in your parents' bedrooms Sometimes, I wanna get on TV and just let loose, but can't But it's cool for Tom Green to hump a dead moose ""My bum is on your lips, my bum is on your lips"" And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss And that's the message that we deliver to little kids And expect them not to know what a woman's clitoris is Of course they gonna know what intercourse is By the time they hit fourth grade They got the Discovery Channel, don't they? ""We ain't nothing but mammals.."" Well, some of us cannibals Who cut other people open like cantaloupes [SLURP] But if we can hump dead animals and antelopes Then there's no reason that a man and another man can't elope [*EWWW!*] But if you feel like I feel, I got the antidote Women wave your pantyhose, sing the chorus and it goes. [Chorus - Eminem (repeat 2x):] 'Cause I'm Slim Shady, yes I'm the real Shady All you other Slim Shadys are just imitating So won't the real Slim Shady please stand up, Please stand up, please stand up?. [Eminem] Will Smith don't gotta cuss in his raps to sell records; Well I do, so fuck him and fuck you too! You think I give a damn about a Grammy? Half of you critics can't even stomach me, let alone stand me ""But Slim, what if you win, wouldn't it be weird?"" Why? So you guys could just lie to get me here? So you can, sit me here next to Britney Spears? Yo Shit, Christina Aguilera better switch me chairs So I can sit next to Carson Daly and Fred Durst And hear 'em argue over who she gave head to first Little bitch, put me on blast on MTV ""Yeah, he's cute, but I think he's married to Kim, hee-hee!"" I should download her audio on MP3 And show the whole world how you gave Eminem VD [AHHH!] I'm sick of you little girl and boy groups, all you do is annoy me So I have been sent here to destroy you [bzzzt] And there's a million of us just like me Who cuss like me; who just don't give a fuck like me Who dress like me; walk, talk and act like me It just might be the next best thing but not quite me!. [Chorus]. [Eminem] I'm like a head trip to listen to, cause I'm only giving you Things you joke about with your friends inside your living room The only difference is I got the balls to say it In front of y'all and I don't gotta be false or sugarcoated at all I just get on the mic and spit it And whether you like to admit it [*ERR*] I just shit it Better than ninety percent of you rappers out can Then you wonder how can kids eat up these albums like Valiums It's funny; 'cause at the rate I'm going when I'm thirty I'll be the only person in the nursing home flirting Pinching nurses asses when I'm jacking off with Jergens And I'm jerking but this whole bag of Viagra isn't working And every single person is a Slim Shady lurking He could be working at Burger King, spitting on your onion rings [*HACH*] Or in the parking lot, circling Screaming ""I don't give a fuck!"" With his windows down and his system up So, will the real Shady please stand up? And put one of those fingers on each hand up? And be proud to be outta your mind and outta control And one more time, loud as you can, how does it go?. [Chorus 4X].

Have you ever been hated or discriminated against?

All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin' Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin' Not takin' nothin' from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathin' Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'.

I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch 'Cause, he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye?

I look at Hailie and I couldn't picture leavin' her side Even if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes but I'm only human But I'm man enough to face them today. What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun 'Cause, I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and him, both It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 'The Eminem Show'. I'm sorry momma I never meant to hurt you I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time. I said, I'm sorry momma I never meant to hurt you I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet. Now, I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin' But put yourself in my position, just try to envision Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen. Bitchin' that someone's always goin' throuh her purse and shit's missin' Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach. Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony. And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom. But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be. I'm sorry momma I never meant to hurt you I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time.

Mockingbird,https://www.metrolyrics.com/mockingbird-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Yeah I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now But hey, what daddy always tell you? Straighten up little soldier Stiffen up that upper lip What you crying about? You got me. Hailie, I know you miss your mom And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone But I'm trying to give you the life that I never had I can see you're sad Even when you smile Even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes Deep inside, you wanna cry 'Cause you're scared I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers No more crying Wipe them tears Daddy's here No more nightmares We gonna pull together through it We gon' do it Laney, uncle's crazy ain't he? Yeah but he loves you girl and you better know it We're all we got in this world When it spins When it swirls When it whirls When it twirls Two little beautiful girls Looking puzzled, in a daze I know it's confusing you Daddy's always on the move Mama's always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that The more it backfires on me All the things, growing up As daddy that he had to see Daddy don't want you to see But you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way Your mother and me But things have got so bad between us I don't see us ever being together ever again Like we used to be when was teenagers But then of course Everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But it's just something We have no control over And that's what destiny is But no more worries Rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up And this will all just be a dream. Now hush little baby don't you cry Everythings gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya, daddy's here to hold ya Through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise, Mama's gonna be alright. It's funny I remember back one year when daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christamas presents up And stuck them under the tree And said some of them were from me 'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night cryin' 'Cause daddy felt like a bum See daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom. And at the time, every house that we lived in Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block And your mom, was saving money For you in a jar trying to start a piggy bank for you So you can go to college Almost had a thousand dollars 'Till someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad, it broke your mama's heart And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart Mom and dad was arguing a lot So mama moved back on the Chalmers in the flat One bedroom apartment And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novarra And that's when daddy went to California with his CD And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me But daddy had to work You and mama had to leave me Then you started seeing daddy on the TV And mama didn't like it And you and Laney were too young to understand it Papa was a rolling stone Mama developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sittin' in this empty house, just reminiscin' Looking at your baby pictures it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown It's almost like your sisters now Wow, I guess you pretty much are And daddy's still here Laney I'm talking to you too Daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah It's got a ring to it, don't it? Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment. Now hush little baby don't you cry Everythings gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady I told ya daddy's here to hold ya Through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We feel how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy pretty baby But I promise Mama's gonna be alright And if you ask me to Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'mma give you the world I'mma buy a diamond ring for you I'mma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'mma break that birdy's neck I'll go back to the jewler who sold it to ya And make him eat every karat Don't fuck with dad, haha",4431,en,
No Love,https://www.metrolyrics.com/no-love-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Throw dirt on me and grow a wildflower But it's ""fuck the world"", get a child out her. Yeah, my life a bitch, but you know nothing bout her Been to hell and back, I can show you vouchers. I'm rolling Sweets, I'm smoking sour Married to the game but she broke her vows. That's why my bars are full of broken bottles And my night stands are full of open Bibles. I think about more than I forget But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat. And these niggas know I lay them down, make your bed Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg. Money outweighing problems on the triple beam I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes. Be good or be good at it Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic. Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's ""fuck what they say"". I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away Man, I come down in a couple of days. OK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode. I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code. It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode. All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole. So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down. No love lost, no love found It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now. You kicked me when I was down. But what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more). That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you Bitch you get (no love). You show me nothing but hate. You ran me into the ground But what comes around goes around. I don't need you (don't hurt me). You (don't hurt me no more). That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you You get (no love) Bitch you get (no love) And I don't need you. Get 'em. I'm alive again. More alive than I have been in my whole entire life. I can see these people's ears perk up as I begin to spaz with the pen,. I'm a little bit sicker than most Shit's finna get thick again. They say the competition is stiff But I get a hard dick from this shit,. now stick it in I ain't never giving in again. Caution to the wind, complete freedom. Look at these rappers, how I treat them So why the fuck would I join them when I beat 'em. They call me a freak cuz I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them. Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage. Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?. Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute. Yeah the rap is tight But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um. Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit. And start over from scratch and write new ones But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference. When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump In the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow. Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd You can see the sparks from hot metal. Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game I so started to rock fellow. When I'm not even in my harshest You can still get roasted because Marsh is not mellow. Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop. I'm standing on my Monopoly board That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop 'Til my hip don't hop anymore (shit). When you so good that you can't say it Because it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore. People just get sick cause you spit. These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore And you can never break my stride. You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow. You'll never take my pride Killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent. Is getting no mercy, mark my words Ain't letting up, relentless. I smell blood, I don't give a fuck Keep giving them hell. Where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love. It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now You kicked me when I was down. But what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more). That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you. Bitch you get (no love) You show me nothing but hate. You ran me into the ground But what comes around goes around. I don't need you (don't hurt me) You (don't hurt me no more). That's right, and I don't need you, don't want to see you.

It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through And don't even realise what you did, believe me you I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of My world, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise To focus only on handling my responsibility's as a father So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it You couldn't lift a single shingle on it Cause the way I feel, I'm strong enough to go to the club Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up Cause I'm raising the bar, I shoot for the moon But I'm too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazed and.

I told the World one day I would pay it back Say it on tape, lay it, record it So that one day I could play it back But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm saying that Doubt's start to creep in, everyday is so gray and black Hope I just need a ray of that Cause no one see's my vision when I play it for em They just say it's wack They don't know what dope is And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest You picked me up, breeding life in me I owe my life to you Before the life of me, I don't see why you don't see like I do But it just dawned on me you lost a son Demons fighting you, it's dark Let me turn on the lights and brighten me and enlighten you I don't think you realize what you mean to me Not the slightest clue Cause me and you were like a crew I was like your sidekick You gon either wanna fight when I get off this fucking mic Or you gon hug me. But I'm out of options, there's nothing else I can do cause.... I'm about to lose my mind You've been gone for so long I'm running out of time. I need a doctor Call me a doctor. I need a doctor, doctor To bring me back to life.. It hurts when I see you struggle You come to me with ideas You say there pieces so I'm puzzled Cause the shit I hear is crazy But your either getting lazy or you don't believe in you no more Seems like your own opinions, not one you can form Cant make a decision, you keep questioning yourself Second guessing and it's almost like you're begging for my help Like I'm your leader Your supposed to fucking be my mentor I can endure no more I demand you remember who you are It was YOU, who believed in me When everyone was telling you don't sign me Everyone at the fucking label, lets tell the truth You risked your career for me I know it as well as you Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy Dre, I'm crying in this booth You saved my life, now maybe its my turn to save yours. But I can never repay you what you did for me is way more But I ain't giving up faith and you ain't giving up on me Get up Dre, I'm dying I need you, come back for fuck's sake.... I'm about to lose my mind You've been gone for so long I'm running out of time. I need a doctor Call me a doctor. I need a doctor, doctor To bring me back to life. Bring me back to life. Bring me back to life.. It literally feels like a lifetime ago But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday though You walked in, yellow jump suit Whole room, cracked jokes Once you got inside the booth, told you, like smoke Went through friends, some of them I put on But they just left, they said was riding to the death But where the fuck are they now Now that I need them I don't see none of 'em All I see is Slim Fuck all you fair-weather friends All I need is him Fucking backstabbers When the chips were down you just laughed at us Now you bout to feel the fucking wrath of aftermath, faggots You gon see us in our lab jackets and ask us where the fuck we been?. You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass Little cracker jack beat making wack math Backwards producers, I'm back bastards One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving I'll guarantee they scream 'Dre, don't leave us like that man' cause I'm about to lose my mind You've been gone for so long I'm running out of time.

Get along with the voices inside of my head You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy. I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek Oh, well, guess beggars can't be choosey Wanted to receive attention for my music Wanted to be left alone in public. Excuse me For wanting my cake and eat it too, and wanting it both ways Fame made me a balloon 'cause my ego inflated When I blew; see, but it was confusing 'Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!)

Now, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me To seize the moment and don't squander it 'Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from (Yeah, pondering'll do you wonders.

Get along with the voices inside of my head You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy Well, that's not fair Well, that's not fair. Call me crazy but I have this vision One day that I'd walk amongst you a regular civilian But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at MC's, blood get spilled and I'll Take you back to the days that I'd get on a Dre track Give every kid who got played that Pumped up feeling and shit to say back To the kids who played him I ain't here to save the fucking children But if one kid out of a hundred million Who are going through a struggle feels it and then relates that's great. It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack Maybe I need a straightjacket, face facts I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that It's nothing, I'm still friends with the.

My mom my mom I know you're probably tired of hearing about my mom Oh ho! Whoa ho! But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty and how I became hooked on va-al-ya-hum Valium was in everything food that I ate, The water that I drank fucking peas on my plate, She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak, So everyday I have at least three stomach aches, Now tell me what kind of mother would want to see her Son grow up to be an under a undera-fuckin-chiever, My teacher didn't think I was going be nothing either, What the fuck you sticking gum up under the fucking seat for? Mrs. Mathers your son has been huffing ether, Either that or the mother fuckers been puffing reefer, But all this huffing and puffing wasn't what it was either, It was neither I was buzzing but it wasn't what she thought, Pee in a tea cup? Bitch you aint my keeper, i'm sleeping, What the fuck you keep on fucking with me for? Slut you need to leave me the fuck alone I aint playing, Go find you a white crayon and color a fucking zebra.. My mom love Valium and lots of drugs, That why I am like I am cause I'm like her, Because my mom love Valium and lots of drugs, That why I'm on what I'm on cause I'm my mom..

Now here's a plate full of pain killers now just wait till I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes you little mother fucker ill make you sit there and make that retarded fucking face without even tasting it, you better lick the fucking plate you aint wasting it, Put your face in it before I throw you in the basement again, And I aint giving in, your gonna just sit there in one fucking place spinning again till next thanksgiving and if you still aint finished it I use the same shit again then when I make spinach dip it will be placed into shit, you little shit want to sit there and play innocent, A rack fell and hit me at k mart and they witnessed it, child support, your father he aint sent us shit and so what if he did that aint none of your dang business kid.. My mom there's no one else quite like my mom I know I should let bygones be bygones But she's the reason why I am high what I'm high on cause..

""I followed you daddy, you told me that you weren't leavin'"" ""You lied to me dad, and now you made mommy sad"" ""And I bought you this coin, it says 'Number One Dad'"" ""That's all I wanted, I just want to give you this coin"" ""I get the point, fine, me and mommy are goin'"" But baby, wait!

I sit back with this pack of Zig-Zags and this bag Of this weed, it gives me the shit needed to be The most meanest MC on this on this Earth And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse And just blurt this berserk and bizarre shit that works And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension Dispensing these sentences, getting this stress That's been eating me recently off of this chest And I rest again peacefully But at least have the decency in you To leave me alone, when you freaks see me out In the streets when I'm eating or feeding my daughter To not come and speak to me I don't know you, and no, I don't owe you a mothafuckin' thing I'm not Mr. N'Sync, I'm not what your friends think I'm not Mr. Friendly, I can be a prick if you tempt me My tank is on empty, no patience is in me And if you offend me, I'm lifting you ten feet in the air I don't care who was there and who saw me just jaw you Go call you a lawyer, file you a lawsuit I'll smile in the courtroom and buy you a wardrobe I'm tired of all you, I don't mean to be mean But that's all I can be, it's just me. And I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am Radio won't even play my jam 'Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am I don't know, it's just the way I am. Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered with all of this nonsense, it's constant And, Oh, it's his lyrical content, the song Guilty Conscience has gotten such rotten responses And all of this controversy circles me And it seems like the media immediately points a finger at me So I point one back at 'em, but not the index or pinkie Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up When you don't give a fuck, when you won't just put up With the bullshit they pull, 'cause they full of shit too When a dude's getting bullied and shoots up his school And they blame it on Marilyn and the heroin Where were the parents at? And look where it's at! Middle America, now it's a tragedy Now it's so sad to see, an upper-class city Havin' this happening Then attack Eminem 'cause I rap this way But I'm glad, 'cause they feed me the fuel that I need for the fire to burn and it's burning, and I have returned. And I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am Radio won't even play my jam 'Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am I don't know, it's just the way I am. I'm so sick and tired of being admired That I wish that I would just die or get fired And dropped from my label, let's stop with the fables I'm not gonna be able to top on ""My Name Is"" And pigeon-holed into some poppy sensation To cop me rotation at rock-n-roll stations And I just do not got the patience To deal with these cocky Caucasians Who think I'm some wigger who just tries to be black 'Cause I talk with an accent, and grab on my balls So they always keep asking the same fucking questions What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in The why, the who, what, when, the where and the how Till I'm grabbing my hair and I'm tearin' it out 'Cause they driving me crazy, I can't take it I'm racin', I'm pacin', I stand and I sit And I'm thankful for every fan that I get But I can't take a shit in the bathroom Without someone standing by it No, I won't sign you an autograph You can call me an asshole, I'm glad, 'cause.... And I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am? In the paper, the news, every day I am Radio won't even play my jam 'Cause I am whatever you say I am If I wasn't, then why would I say I am?

I have no snare in my headphones - there you go Yeah... yo, yo. Have you ever been hated or discriminated against? I have; I've been protested and demonstrated against Picket signs for my wicked rhymes, look at the times Sick as the mind of the motherfucking kid that's behind All this commotion emotions run deep as ocean's exploding Tempers flaring from parents just blow 'em off and keep going Not taking nothing from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathing Keep kicking ass in the morning and taking names in the evening Leave 'em with a taste as sour as vinegar in they mouth. See they can trigger me, but they'll never figure me out Look at me now; I bet ya probably sick of me now ain't you momma? I'mma make you look so ridiculous now. I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time). I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet. Ha! I got some skeletons in my closet And I don't know if no one knows it So before they thrown me inside my coffin and close it I'mma expose it; I'll take you back to '73 Before I ever had a multi-platinum selling CD I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye No I don't. On second thought I just fucking wished he would die I look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leaving her side Even if I hated Kim, I grit my teeth and I'd try To make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake I maybe made some mistakes. But I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face them today What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun Cause I'da killed him; shit I would've shot Kim and him both It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to ""The Eminem Show"". I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you!. I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet. Now I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissing But put yourself in my position; just try to envision Witnessing your momma popping prescription pills in the kitchen Bitching that someone's always going through her purse and shit's missing Going through public housing systems, victim of Munchhausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't 'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're getting older now and it's cold when you're lonely And Nathan's growing up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony And Hailie's getting so big now; you should see her, she's beautiful. But you'll never see her - she won't even be at your funeral! See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song - keep telling yourself that you was a mom! But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch; I hope you fucking burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well guess what, I am dead - dead to you as can be!. I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet (one more time) I said I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you! I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleaning out my closet I'm sorry momma! I never meant to hurt you!

Beautiful Pain,https://www.metrolyrics.com/beautiful-pain-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"I can feel the heat rising Everything is on fire Today is a painful reminder of why We can only get brighter The further you put it behind ya And right now I'm on the inside Lookin' out, 'cause. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. Yesterday was the tornado warning Today is like the morning after Your world is torn in half, you wake And let's wait to start the morning process Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass The thunderstorm has passed ya Your weather didn't poke his eyes out With the thorn bush that you Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale Can't even tell your nose is stuffed So focused on the brightside, then you floor The gas pedal, and hit the corner fast The more asserted, never looking back May hit the curb But everyday is a new learning curve As you, steer through life Sometimes you might not wanna swerve But you have to, to avert a disaster Lucky, no permanent damage 'Cause they hurt you so bad It's like they murdered your ass And threw dirt on your casket But you returned from the ashes And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline And while you're burning the past Standing at inferno and chant. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. So familiarize With what having to swallow this pill is like It happens all the time, they take your heart And steal your life And it's as though you feel you've died Because you've been killed inside But yet you're still alive which means You will survive Although today you may weep because you're weak and Everything seems so bleak and hopeless The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in That's the only thing keepin' you From leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling And with a little time that should do the healin' And by tomorrow you may even feel so good That you're willing To forgive them even after All that shit you been put through This feeling of resilience is building And the flames are burning Quick as fire would through this building You're sealed in But your fireproof and retardant you withstood it And as you climb up to the roof You're just chillin' and you look down 'Cause you're so over them you could Put the heel of your foot through the ceiling. As time passes, things change everyday But wounds? Wounds heal But scars still remaining the same But tomorrow today's gone down in flames Throw the match at the passed up place. So feel the fire beneath your feet As you barely even perspire from the heat Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief And as you say goodbye to the grief It's like watching the walls melt In your prison cell But you've extinguished this living hell Still a little piece of you dies, you scream. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn rising A phoenix from the flames Flame of love, we're going to fight the word, fight Now it feels with these wings that I will fly. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light:",3914,en,
White America,https://www.metrolyrics.com/white-america-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"America, hahaha, we love you How many people are proud to be citizens of this beautiful country of ours The stripes and the stars for the rights that men have died for to protect The women and men who have broke their necks for the freedom of speech The United States government has sworn to uphold, or so we're told. I never woulda dreamed in a million years I'd see So many motherfuckin' people, who feel like me Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs It's like a fucking army marching in back of me So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays 'til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days Who woulda thought, standing in this mirror bleaching my hair With some peroxide, reaching for a t-shirt to wear That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this? How could I predict my words would have an impact like this I musta struck a chord with somebody up in the office Cause Congress keep telling me, I ain't causing nothing but problems And now they're sayin' I'm in trouble with the government, I'm lovin' it. I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it on. White America, I could be one of your kids White America, little Eric looks just like this.

No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up I was like, ""Fuck it"" Until I met Dre, the only one to look past Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass. Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got Like damn; we just swapped: sitting back, looking at shit, wow I'm like my skin is just starting to work to my benefit now?

That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in And they connected with me too because I looked like them That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope Searching with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope Waiting to choke; tightening around my throat.

Entertainment is changing, intertwining with gangsters In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum Holy or unholy, only have one homie Only this gun, lonely cause don't anyone know me Yet everybody just feels like they can relate I guess words are a mothafucka, they can be great Or they can degrade, or even worse, they can teach hate It's like these kids hang on every single statement we make Like they worship us, plus all the stores ship us platinum Now how the fuck did this metamorphosis happen? From standing on corners and porches just rapping To having a fortune, no more kissing ass But then these critics crucify you, journalists try to burn you Fans turn on you, attorneys all want a turn at you To get they hands on every dime you have They want you to lose your mind every time you mad So they can try to make you out to look like a loose cannon Any dispute won't hesitate to produce handguns That's why these prosecutors wanna convict me Strictly just to get me off of these streets quickly But all their kids been listening to me religiously So I'm signing CD's while police fingerprint me They're for the judge's daughter but his grudge is against me If I'm such a fucking menace this shit doesn't make sense B It's all political, if my music is literal Then I'm a criminal, how the fuck can I raise a little girl? I couldn't, I wouldn't be fit to You're full of shit too Guerrera; that was a fist that hit you. Sing with me, sing for the year (sing it) Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear (sing this shit!) Sing it with me, just for today Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away. They say music can alter moods and talk to you Well, can it load a gun up for you and cock it too? Well if it can, and the next time you assault a dude Just tell the judge it was my fault, and I'll get sued See what these kids do is hear 'bout us toting pistols And they wanna get one cause, they think the shit's cool Not knowing we really just protecting ourselves We entertainers, of course the shit's affecting our sales You ignoramus, but music is reflection of self We just explain it, and then we get our checks in the mail It's fucked up ain't it? How we can come from practically nothing To being able to have any fucking thing that we wanted That's why we, sing for these kids who don't have a thing Except for a dream and a fucking rap magazine Who post pin-up pictures on they walls all day long Idolize their favorite rappers and know all their songs Or for anyone who's ever been through shit in they lives So they sit and they cry at night wishing they'd die 'til they throw on a rap record and they sit and they vibe We're nothing to you, but we're the fucking shit in their eyes That's why we, seize the moment try to freeze it and own it Squeeze it and hold it, cause we consider these minutes golden And maybe they'll admit it when we're gone Just let our spirits live on Through our lyrics that you hear in our songs and we can.

8 Mile,https://www.metrolyrics.com/8-mile-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Sometimes I just feel like, quittin' I still might Why do I put up this fight, why do I still write Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics. And show these people what my level of skill's like But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life Somethin ain't right, hit the brake lights Case of the stage fright, drawin a blank like Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl And I clam up I just slam shut I just can't do it, my whole manhood's Just been stripped, I have just been vicked So I must then get, off the bus then split Man fuck this shit; yo, I'm goin' the fuck home. World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road. I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land Time to really just take matters into my own hands Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back (8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone. Ain't gon' follow the footsteps I'm makin' my own Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road. I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap To the same plant, in the same pants Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP. And get a new plan, momma's got a new man. Poor little baby sister, she don't understand Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad. And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand. While she colors her big brother and mother and dad Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad! Sometimes I get upset, cause I ain't blew up yet It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep The pressure's too much man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best And I try, sit alone and I cry Yo I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by That I don't pray to the sky, please I'm beggin' you God Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job Yo I hope you can hear me homey wherever you are Yo I'm tellin' you dawg I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye. Say whenever you need me baby, I'm never too far But yo I gotta get out there, the only way I know And I'mma be back for you, the second that I blow On everything I own, I'll make it on my own Off to work I go, back to this 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land Time to really just take matters into my own hands Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back (8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone.

Who must I show, to bust my flow? Where must I go? Who must I know? Or am I just another crab in the bucket? Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little Rabbit so fuck it Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin to doubt shit I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with I look like a bum, yo my clothes ain't about shit At the Salvation Army tryin to salvage an outfit And it's cold, tryin' to travel this road Plus I feel like I'm on stuck in this battlin mode My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want Is pity from no one, the city is no fun There is no sun, and it's so dark Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not What I'm doin I just blow, my head is a stove top I just explode, the kettle gets so hot Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn Yo it only takes one time for me to get burned Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl I can no longer play stupid or be immature I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred Time to show these free world leaders the 3 and a third I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird Then I turn and cross over the median curb Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road I'm a man, I'mma make a new plan Time for me to just stand up, and travel new land Time to really just take matters into my own hands Once I'm over these tracks man I'mma never look back (8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin Sorry momma I'm grown, I must travel alone.

Bad Guy,https://www.metrolyrics.com/bad-guy-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"It's like I'm in this dirt, digging up old hurt Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work All it takes is one song on the radio you're right back on it Reminding me all over again how you fucking just brushed me off And left me so burnt, spent a lot of time trying to soul search Maybe I needed to grow up a little first Well, looks like I hit a growth spurt But I am coming for closure Don't suppose an explanation I'm owed for The way that you turned your back on me Just when I may have needed you most Oh, you thought it was over You can just close the chapter And go about your life, like it was nothing You ruined mine, but you seem to be doing fine I'd never recovered but tonight I betcha that whatcha 'bout to go through's tougher than anything I ever have suffered Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice Can I hold grudges, mind is saying: ""let it go, fuck this"" Heart is saying: ""I will once I bury this bitch alive"" ""Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset"". I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy. And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch To think it was you at one time I worshipped, shit Think you can hurt people and just keep getting away with it Not this time, you better go and get sewing kit, bitch Finish this stitch so you can reap what you sow, nitwit Thought some time had past and I forget it, forget it! You left our family in shambles You expect me to just get over him Pretend he never existed Maybe gone, but he's not forgotten And don't think 'cause he's been out the pictures so long That I've stopped the plottin' and still ain't coming to get ya You're wrong and that shit was rotten And the way you played him, same shit you did to me, go! Have you any idea that shit I've gone through Feelings I harbor, all this pent up resentment I hold on to Not once you called to ask me how I'm doing Letters, you don't respond to 'em Fuck it, I'm coming to see you And gee who better to talk to than you The cause of my problems My life is garbage and I'm 'bout to take it out on you Poof, then I'm gone, whoosh. I flee the scene like it was my last ride You see right through, oh, you had me pegged the first time You can't see the truth but it's easier to justify what's bad is good And I hate to be the bad guy, I just hate to be the bad guy. I've been driving around your side of this town Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now Finally I found your new address, park in your drive Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house See, it's sad it came to this point Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology Or your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seek So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window Like I reach my full potential, I peaked Continue to peep, still bent low Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this You don't plan for intruders before hand Surprised to see me, cat got your tongue Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack up a lung Like you picked up an axe up and then swung Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh Now who's a faggot, you punk And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck It's just me, you and the music now, Slim I hope you hear it, we are in a car right now Wait, here comes my favorite lyric ""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"" And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP Just to try to get people to buy How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done Eminem killed by M&M Matthew Mitchell Bitch, I even have your initials I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it Since you love your city so much I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here Two more exits, town is quite near I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea As cops appear in my driver side mirror Oh, God, police! Ahh! Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least New plan Stan Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh, hope you can swim good! Now say you hate homos again!. I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in When they say all of this is approaching its end But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again Backs to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds Toilets clogged, Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollas After the track is demolished I am your lack of a conscience I'm the ringing in your ears I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils Eating your vocal chords after your concerts I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow I'm the bullies you hate, that you became With every faggot you slaughtered Coming back on you every woman you insult That, with the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters I represent everything, you take for granted 'Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic, of you not knowing what you had until it's gone 'Cause after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are calling your name Cameras are off Sad, but it happens to all of them I'm the hindsight to say, ""I told you so!"" Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow If you don't stop after they call you the Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits When it's time to walk away I'm every guilt trip The baggage you had But as you gather up all your possessions If there's anything you have left to say Unless it makes an impact don't bother So before you rest your case Better make sure you're packing a wallop So one last time, I'm back Before it fades into black and it's all over Behold the final chapter in the saga Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle Twice the magic that started it all Tragic portrait of an artist tortured Trapped in his own drawings Tap into thoughts Blacker and darker than anything imaginable Here goes a wild stab in the dark As we pick up the last Mathers left off",7146,en,

[Verse 1: Eminem] Why are expectations so high? Is it the bar I set? My arms, I stretch, but I can't reach A far cry from it, or it's in my grasp, but as Soon as I grab, squeeze I lose my grip like the flyin' trapeze Into the dark I plummet, now the sky's blackening I know the mark's high, butter- flies rip apart my stomach Knowin' that no matter what bars I come with You're gonna harp, gripe, and That's a hard Vicodin to swallow, so I scrap these As pressure increases like khakis I feel the ice cracking, becauseâ. [Chorus: BeyoncÃ© & Eminem] I walk on water But I ain't no Jesus I walk on water (shit) But only when it freezes. [Verse 2: Eminem] It's the curse of the standard That the first of the Mathers discs set Always in search of the verse that I haven't spit yet Will this step just be another misstep To tarnish whatever the legacy, love or respect I've garnered? The rhyme has to be perfect, the delivery flawless And it always feels like I'm hittin' the mark 'Til I go sit in the car, listen and pick it apart Like, ""This shit is garbage!"" God's given me all this, still I feel no different regardless Kids look to me as a god, this is retarded If only they knew, it's a facade and it's exhaustive And I try not to listen to nonsense But if you bitches are tryin' to strip me of my confidence Mission accomplished I'm not God-sent, Nas, Rakim, Pac, B.I.G., James Todd Smith And I'm not Prince, so....

[Verse 3: Eminem] It's true, I'm a Rubik's â a beautiful mess At times juvenile, yes, I goof and I jest A flawed human, I guess But I'm doin' my best to not ruin your ex- pectations and meet 'em, but first The ""Speedom"" verse, now Big Sean He's goin' too fast, is he gonna shout or curse out his mom? There was a time I had the world by the balls, eatin' out my palm Every album song I was spazzin' the fuck out on And now I'm gettin' clowned and frowned on But the only one who's looking down on Me that matters now's DeShaun Am I lucky to be around this long? Begs the question though Especially after the methadone As yesterday fades and the Dresden home Is burnt to the ground, and all that's left of my house is lawn The crowds are gone And it's time to wash out the blonde Sales decline, the curtain's drawn They're closin' the set, I'm still pokin' my head from out behind And everyone who has doubt, remind Now take your best rhyme, outdo it, now do it a thousand times Now let 'em tell ya the world no longer cares or gives a fuck about your rhymes And as I grow outta sight, outta mind, I might go outta mine 'Cause how do I ever let this mic go without a fight When I made a fuckin' tightrope outta twine? But when I do fall from these heights though, I'll be fine I won't pout or cry or spiral down or whine But I'll decide if it's my final bow this time around, 'causeâ.

Phenomenal,https://www.metrolyrics.com/phenomenal-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible' Cause I'm born to be phenomenal. Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles Stomp you in the verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em When the going got rough Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy Who the fuck taught you how to persevere? There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well Hang it up like a shelf, gotta keep growin' with it, evolve Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself Time to slip in that zone till' I find myself Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go Into waters where nobody else has gone before Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so. Bomb, I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant. Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am.... I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths. It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal. But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible' Cause I'm born to be phenomenal. Let me self-empower you When you're down and they're tryin' to clown the fuck out of you And you feel like you're runnin' out of fuel I'll show you how to use doubt as fuel Convert it to gunpowder too Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage Never take back what you say If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match Ready to scrap asap Take your fists and just ball it. Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at. And set it on 'em like a placemat (I am phenomenal) And I want you to say that. I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood. With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal. I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths. It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal. But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible' Cause I'm born to be phenomenal. Step into the unknown and find yourself You're floating freely, no emotion. Got a fuckin' mouth with no shut-off valve Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground Cause I worked my butt off now It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about Cause I stuck it out Like a motherfucking tongue thats how, I responded when I got shoved around You're gonna have non-believers But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how Get it how you live But are you prepared to give more than you get? And put in twice what you get back from this shit Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give Rap is my shiv But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt Ready to face any challenge, waitin' Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation Look what I have built, reputation is validation. The only thing I'm capable of makin' is amazing Only thing you're capable of makin' is a false statement Or accusation... I am legendary status, in fact That is the only way you'll ever be able to say Your legend is makin' an allegation I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath. Managed to prove who the best man is Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standing In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage Of knowing what it's like to be southpaw Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed. I am phenomenal With every ounce of my blood With every breath in my lungs Won't stop until I'm phe-no-menal I am phenomenal However long that it takes I'll go to whatever lengths It's gonna make me a monster though I am phenomenal But I would never say, 'Oh, it's impossible' Cause I'm born to be phenomenal",4527,en,

It's like a drop in the ocean a change in the weather, I was praying that you and me might end up together.. So young, so full of life and vibrant, Side by side wherever you was ridin', I went, So close almost was some Bonnie and Clyde shit, When Ronnie died you was right by my side, With a shoulder to cry on and a tissue to wipe my eyes, And a bucket to catch every tear I cried inside it, You even had the same type of childhood I did, Sometimes I just wanna know why, Is it that you surcame to yours, And mine I survived it, You ran the streets I nine to fived it, We grew up, grew apart as time went by us, Then I blew up to both yours and mine surprises, Now I feel the vibe I just cant describe it, Much as your pride tries to hide it, You're cold your touch, its like ice, And your eyes is the look of resentment, I can sense it and I don't like it.

Guts Over Fear,https://www.metrolyrics.com/guts-over-fear-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Feels like a close, it's coming to Fuck am I gonna do? It's too late to start over This is the only thing I, thing I know. Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways to word the same, old song Ever since I came along From the day the song called ''Hi! My Name Is"" dropped Started thinking my name was fault Cause anytime things went wrong I was the one who they would blame it on The media made me the, uh, equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws And the fangs been out since then But up until the instant that I've went against it It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught Do I really belong in this game? I pondered I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not? So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme? What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are When I was afraid to.... I was a... Afraid to make a single sound Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out Afraid I'd never be found I didn't wanna go another round An angry man's power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear, the time is here Guts over fear, I shall not tear For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear. Feels like a close, it's coming to Fuck am I gonna do? It's too late to start over This is the only thing I, thing I know. It's like I was there once, single parents Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world? And the pain spawns all the anger on But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit Learned how to harness it while the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck"" Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone? And the lights go out in that trailer park? And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song But I'd rather make ""Not Afraid 2"" than make another mothafuckin' ""We Made You"" uh Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise, pray to God I just opened enough eyes later on And gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt Just having to balance my dang self But on eggshells I was made to walk But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone And to think I was... gone. I was a... Afraid to make a single sound Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out Afraid I'd never be found I didn't wanna go another round An angry man's power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear, the time is here Guts over fear, I shall not tear For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear",4704,en,

Drug Ballad,https://www.metrolyrics.com/drug-ballad-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Guess what? I ain't coming in yet I'll come in in a minute Ayo this is my love song It goes like this.

'Cause every time I go to try to leave Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve I dont wanna but I gotta stay These drugs really gotta hold on me 'Cause everytime I try ta tell 'em no They won't let me ever let 'em go I'm a sucker all I gotta say Is drugs really gotta hold on me?. In third grade all I used to do Was sniff glue through a tube and play rubix cube Seventeen years later I'm as rude as you Schemein on the first chick with the hugest boobs I got no game and every face looks the same They got no name so i don't need game to play I just say whatever I want, to whoever I want Whenever i want, wherever I want, however I want However I do show some respect to few This ecstacy has got me standin' next to you Gettin' sentimental as fuck, spillin' guts to you We just met but I think I'm in love with you But you're on it too so you tell me you love me too Wake up in the morning like ""Yo what the fuck we do?"" I gotta go bitch, you know I got stuff to do 'Cause if I get caught cheatin' then I'm stuck with you But in the long run these drugs are probably gonna catch up sooner or later But fuck it I'm on one so let's enjoy Let the X destroy your spinal chord So it's not a straight line no more So we walk around lookin' like some windup dolls Shit stickin' out of our backs like a dinosaur Shit six hits won't even get me high no more So bye for now I'm gonna try to find some more. 'Cause every time I go to try to leave Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve I dont wanna but I gotta stay These drugs really gotta hold on me 'Cause everytime I try ta tell 'em no They won't let me ever let 'em go I'm a sucker all I gotta say Is drugs really gotta hold on me?. That's the sound of a bottle when it's hollow When you swallow it all Wallow and drown in your sorrow And tomorrow your probably gonna wanna do it again What's a little spinal fluid between you and a friend, screw it And what's a little bit of alcohol poisoning? And what's a little fight? Tomorrow you'll be boys again It's your life live it however you wanna Marijuana is everywhere, where was you brought up? It don't matter as long as you get where you're goin' 'Cause none of this shit's gonna mean shit where we're goin' They tell you to stop but you just sit there ignorin' Even though you wake up feelin' like shit every morning But your young you got a lot of drugs to do Girls to screw, parties to crash, sucks to be you If I could take it all back now I wouldn't I would've did more shit that people said that I shouldnt But I'm all grown up now and upgraded And graduated to better drugs and updated But I still gotta a lot of growin' up to do I still gotta whole lot of throwin' up to spew But when it's all said and done before I know it I'll be forty with a forty on the porch tellin' stories With a bottle of Jack, two grandkids on my lap Babysitting for Hailie, while Hailie's out gettin' smashed. 'Cause every time I go to try to leave Somethin' keeps pullin' on my sleeve I dont wanna but I gotta stay These drugs really gotta hold on me Cause everytime I try ta tell 'em no They won't let me ever let 'em go I'm a sucker all I gotta say Is drugs really gotta hold on me?.

Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't (want her) Now you probably get this picture from my public persona That I'm a pistol packin' drug addict, who bags on his mama But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest 'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled, that hurts deep inside Of my soul and just know that I grow colder the older I grow This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold And this load is like the weight of the world And I think my neck is breakin' Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations? Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt So many chances, man, it's too bad, could have had someone else But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted So here's what I'm facin', three felonies, six years of probation I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman Man, I should have seen it coming, what I stick my penis up in? Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'? But fuck it, it is over, there's no more reason to cry no more I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore, Hailie So sayonara, try tommorra, nice to know ya Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted. And now it don't feel like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leaning on me 'Cause my baby knows that her dad's a soldier Nothing can take her from me. Told you I can't sing Oh, well, I tried Hailie, remember when I said If you ever need anything Daddy would be right there? Guess what? Daddy's here And I ain't going nowhere Baby, I love you",3251,en,

Here I sit while I'm caught up in deep thought again Contemplating my next plot again Swallowing the Calotapin While I'm nodding in and out on the ottoman At the Ramada Inn holding onto the pill bottle then Lick my finger and swirl it round the bottom And make sure I got all of it, wake up naked At McDonald's with blood all over me Dead bodies behind the counter, shit Guess I must've just blacked out again, not again It's 3 A.M. in the morning Put my key in the door and Bodies laying all over the floor and I don't remember how they got there But I guess I must've killed 'em (Killed 'em) I said Its 3 AM in the morning Put my keys in the door and Bodies laying all over the floor and I don't remember how they got here But i guess i must've killed 'em.

Then I reach for the aloe and lanolin. Bust all over the wall paneling Dismantling every candle on top Of the fire place mantle and grab my flannel And my bandanna then Kiss the naked mannequin man again.

I cut and I slash slice and gash Last night was a blast I can't quite remember when I had that Much fun off a half-pint of a Jack My last vic and a half, a flashlight up. Kim Kardashian's ass, I remember the first time. I dismembered a family member, December I think it was, I was having drinks with my cousin I wrapped him in Christmas lights Pushed him into the stinking tub Cut him up into pieces and just. When I went to drink his blood I thought I oughta' drink his bathwater that oughta' be fun That's when my days of serial murder manslaughter begun The sight of blood excites me that might be an artery son Your blood curdling screams just don't seem to bother me none It's 3 A.M. and here I come so you should probably run. A secret passageway around here, man There's got to be one, oh no, there's probably none He can scream all that he wants, top of his lungs But ain't no stopping me from chopping him up (Up) It's 3 A.M. in the morning Put my key in the door and Bodies laying all over the floor and I don't remember how they got there But I guess I must've killed 'em (Killed 'em)",3708,en,

Not that man Half you don't got the guts, intestinal blockage, rest of you got lap bands Stuck to this motto 'fore they put bath salts in all those Water bottles in Colorado, so get lost, Waldo my soul's escaping through this asshole that is gaping A black hole and I'm swallowin' this track whole, better pack toilet paper But I'm takin' no crap hoe, here I go down the Bat Pole and I'm changing back into that ole maniac in fact there they go, tryin' to dip out the back door retreating 'Cause everybody knows.

All Fall Down,https://www.metrolyrics.com/all-fall-down-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Yeah I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now But hey, what daddy always tell you? Straighten up little soldier Stiffen up that upper lip What you crying about? You got me. Hailie, I know you miss your mom and I know you miss your dad Well I'm gone but I'm trying to give you the life that I never had I can see you're sad, even when you smile, even when you laugh I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you want to cry 'Cause you're scared, I ain't there? Daddy's with you in your prayers No more crying, wipe them tears Daddy's here, no more nightmares We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it Laney uncles crazy, ain't he? Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it We're all we got in this world When it spins, when it swirls When it whirls, when it twirls Two little beautiful girls Lookin' puzzled, in a daze I know it's confusing you Daddy's always on the move, mamma's always on the news I try to keep you sheltered from it but somehow it seems The harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me All the things growing up. As daddy there, he had to see. Daddy don't want you to see but you see just as much as he did We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me But things have gotten so bad between us I don't see us ever being together ever again Like we used to be when we were teenagers But then of course everything always happens for a reason I guess it was never meant to be But it's just something we have no control over and that's what destiny is But no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep Maybe one day we'll wake up and this will all just be a dream. [Chorus:] Now hush little baby, don't you cry Everything's gonna be alright Stiffen that upper lip up little lady, I told ya Daddy's here to hold ya through the night I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why We fear how we feel inside It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby But I promise momma's gon' be alright. It's funny I remember back one year when daddy had no money Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up And stuck 'em under the tree and said some of 'em were from me 'Cause daddy couldn't buy 'em I'll never forget that Christmas I sat up the whole night crying 'Cause daddy felt like a bum, see daddy had a job But his job was to keep the food on the table for you and mom And at the time every house that we lived in Either kept getting broken into and robbed Or shot up on the block and your mom was saving money for you in a jar Tryna start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college Almost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it And I know it hurt so bad it broke your momma's heart And it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart Mom and dad was arguin' a lot so momma moved back On the Chalmers in the flat one bedroom apartment And dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara And that's when daddy went to California with his CD and met Dr. Dre And flew you and momma out to see me But daddy had to work, you and momma had to leave me Then you started seeing daddy on the T.V. and momma didn't like it And you and Laney were too young to understand it Papa was a rollin' stone, momma developed a habit And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it first hand 'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud Now I'm sitting in this empty house, just reminiscing Lookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out To see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here Laney I'm talkin' to you too, daddy's still here I like the sound of that, yeah It's got a ring to it don't it? Shh, momma's only gone for the moment. [Chorus]. And if you ask me too Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird I'mma give you the world I'mma buy a diamond ring for you I'mma sing for you I'll do anything for you to see you smile And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine I'mma break that birdie's neck I'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya And make him eat every carat don't fuck with dad (ha ha)",4167,en,

I've been driving around your side of this town Like 9 frickin' hours and 45 minutes now Finally I found your new address, park in your drive Feel like I been waiting on this moment all of my life And it's now arrived, and my mouth is full of saliva My knife is out and I'm ducking on the side of your house See, it's sad it came to this point Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment to come and see ya But ain't here for ya empathy, I don't need your apology Or your friendship or sympathy, it's revenge that I seek So I sneak vengefully and treat your bedroom window Like I reach my full potential, I peaked Continue to peep, still bent low Keep tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo Sneak all the way 'round to the back porch Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this You don't plan for intruders before hand Surprised to see me, cat got your tongue Gag, chloroform rag, gag almost hack up a lung Like you picked up an axe up and then swung Stick to the core plan, drag to the back of a trunk By one of your fans, irony spectacular, huh Now who's a faggot, you punk And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck It's just me, you and the music now, Slim I hope you hear it, we are in a car right now Wait, here comes my favorite lyric ""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die"" And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP Just to try to get people to buy How's this for publicity stunt? This should be fun Last album now, 'cause after this you'll be officially done Eminem killed by M&M Matthew Mitchell Bitch, I even have your initials I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it Since you love your city so much I figured, what the fuck the best place you could be buried alive is right here Two more exits, town is quite near I hope we don't get stopped, no license I fear That sirens I hear? Guess 90 on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea As cops appear in my driver side mirror Oh, God, police! Ahh! Hope foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least New plan Stan Slim, chauvinist pig drove in this big, lincoln town car Well gotta go, almost at the bridge, haha big bro it's for you Slim, this is for him and Frank Ocean, oh, hope you can swim good! Now say you hate homos again!. I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend I'm the nightmare you fell asleep in and woke up still in I'm your karma closing in with each stroke of a pen Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin No, it's hopeless, I'm the denial that you're hopelessly in When they say all of this is approaching its end But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again Backs to the wall, I'm stacking up all them odds Toilets clogged, Yeah 'cause I'm talking a lot of shit but I'm backing it all up But in my head there's a voice in the back and it hollas After the track is demolished I am your lack of a conscience I'm the ringing in your ears I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils Eating your vocal chords after your concerts I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged Grab for some water but I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow I'm the bullies you hate, that you became With every faggot you slaughtered Coming back on you every woman you insult That, with the double-standards you have when it comes to your daughters I represent everything, you take for granted 'Cause Marshall Mathers the rapper's persona's half a facade And Matthew and Stan's just symbolic, of you not knowing what you had until it's gone 'Cause after all the glitz and the glam, no more fans that are calling your name Cameras are off Sad, but it happens to all of them I'm the hindsight to say, ""I told you so!"" Foreshadows of all the things that are to follow I'm the future that's here to show you what happens tomorrow If you don't stop after they call you the Biggest laughing stock of rap who can't call it quits When it's time to walk away I'm every guilt trip The baggage you had But as you gather up all your possessions If there's anything you have left to say Unless it makes an impact don't bother So before you rest your case Better make sure you're packing a wallop So one last time, I'm back Before it fades into black and it's all over Behold the final chapter in the saga Trying to recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle Twice the magic that started it all Tragic portrait of an artist tortured Trapped in his own drawings Tap into thoughts Blacker and darker than anything imaginable Here goes a wild stab in the dark As we pick up the last Mathers left off",7146,en,
Bad Guys Always Die,https://www.metrolyrics.com/bad-guys-always-die-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"[Intro] The Wild Gotham The Wild West Ah ha, ride. [Dre] All you see is the sun reflectin' off of the gun Ready for the showdown to go down at 1 Sweat on my brow, let's settle it now I'mma show you how real cowboys get down I'm polishin' gold, waiting for this drama to unfold I got a blunt rolled Feelin' bold, gangsta's blood run cold It's time to reload this old 45 Colt And the wind gust, it's hot and muggy, dusty Bust a couple shots, make sure I'm not rusty It's passed noon, he should be here soon I sip a little moonshine inside a saloon All of a sudden I could hear the sound of hoofs Sounds like a thousand wolves I cock back, put the toast in the holster and frooze I pose like a poster, he's closer than close I hold the heat sturdy, I heard he fight's dirty But I'mma put thirty inside him and leave early And just when I went to fill him with hot lead I put the gun to his head and this is what he said. [Eminem] You never met me and you'll probably never see me again But I know you, the name's Slim You want revenge? Then don't shoot, I'm in the same boots as you I'm telling the truth, I got a price on my head, too Cuz when you. [Chorus] Ride like a cowboy toward the sun When life ain't fun, when you're on the run Got your gold and you got your gun But life as an outlaw just begun. Got your shotgun by your side Got your horse and you got your pride You ride 'till there ain't no place to hide It's sad cuz the bad guys always die. [Dre] He was shady, could see it by the look on his face He said take ten paces, shit, I took eight Spun around and I aimed straight for the brain My shit went bang but it only fired a blank, he said. [Eminem] You need bullets, hurry up run. [Dre] I put a clip in the gun, and pointed at his lungs He pulled two at the same time and stood stunned. [Eminem] Go ahead, shoot me, but I'm not the one you want. [Dre] I figured he was telling the truth That's why I didn't shoot So what we gonna do? It's on you. [Eminem] Do you recall when you and Snoop was a group?. [Dre] The Chronic. [Eminem] Well, all we gotta do is find a map to part two And plus I know who's got it (Who?) Some old dude, he's got 26 plagues and he already sold two. [Dre] Loaded up my saddle, got ready for battle Hid two pieces of gold inside of my saddle We rolled two miles until we hit the spot An old ghost town that everybody forgot A place where they used to smoke chronic a lot Slim grabbed the shotgun. [Eminem] Dre, here's the plot This is the spot, they call him Doc Loveless He's going around saying he took the game from us. [Dre] Let's shoot him in his kneecaps, he'll never see it coming. [Eminem] He ain't got no legs, they cut 'em off at the stomach He's got mechanical legs and spins webs Plus he's well respected by the hip-hop heads Our mission is to get him to stop laying eggs And we can put him on his back down a flight of steps. [Dre] I drew two guns, spun them on my fingers Kicked the swinging doors in and started gun slinging I could hear somebody singing It sounded like a G Thang in a verse from Keep Their Heads Ringing I said it's Dre's Day and started to spray It's eighteen hundred, he proves a AK Hollow tips started flying every which way. [Eminem] That's when I seen Dre in trouble, then came the brigades I fired the first shot, spun his body around He hit the ground and landed upside down Dre grabbed the map, the plagues and the gold I grabbed two girlies and a blunt that's rolled. [Chorus]. [Chorus]. Always die The Wild Gotham The Wild West Ah ha, ride Got your shotgun by your side Got your horse and you got your pride You ride 'till there ain't no place to hide It's sad cuz the bad guys always die.

Bad Husband,https://www.metrolyrics.com/bad-husband-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"We never saw from each other's sides Or eye to eye Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight So much baggage, need a luggage rack But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds Oh, back in the news Love taps when I diss you Like it was fun Actually used to run Back to the booth Jump back in the studio Give you a tongue Lashing than you Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb Stoning was fun, back in our youth But then it wasn't after we knew That we were done and actually through (and actually through) But if there's one fraction of truth If it could be spun back I would do so many things different. 'cause it was such a dumbass excuse You hit me once And that I would use to continue the pattern of abuse. Why did I punch back?. Girls your dad is a scumbag. I'm confused because. How come you can be a lord of illusion How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father? A good dad, but a bad husband Why are you a good father? A great dad, but a bad husband. You wouldn't beat our love with a writer's block Just a line that's hot, that I forgot We laughed a little, cried a lot I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie Day before you went to jail and daily How we would wait for that mail lady Or by the phone, for mom to call And I watch you pull yourself up And we decided on giving it one more try despite it all You're my lightning rod When my sky gets dark I'm your shiny rocks. In that tiny box. When we tied the knot. When we broke the knot Every line we crossed We were supposed to not Every time we fought Being souls that got Thrown too far Words that we said that we didn't mean. The words that we meant that we didn't say. The ones that we thought that should've said Letters written that we could've read. Which maybe would've lead to some good instead And had this put to bed But I'd be lying still if I said I wasn't sitting here asking myself. How come you can be a lord of illusion How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father? A good dad, but a bad husband Why are you a good father? A great dad, but a bad husband (dad) (you said) Forever be a hero in my eyes In my eyes But there's always another side to a good father A great dad, but a bad husband. We brought out the worst in each other Someone had to make the sparring end Cause I loved you but I hated that me And I don't wanna see that side again But I'm sorry Kim More than you could ever comprehend Leaving you was fucking harder than Sawing off a fucking body limb Once upon a time where all we had Maybe that was what drew us to each other It was true love shit that we never knew was possible We might have loved each other too much And maybe that's what made us do what we did to each other All the screw-ups Cause you always thought that you was more in love with me And I was thinking I was more in love than you was For all the times that we thought it worked Till we saw how wrong we were When the dust settles now And all the dirt. And if I touch the rawest nerve All I want is for us not to hurt. And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words But I just heard Mockingbird And got the urge to jot me some verses and thoughts The purpose was not to stir up open wounds. I've got a few And so have you Or argue who's fault it was Partly yours, partly mine But really no ones This is so tough I'm getting choked up Oh fuck it, we both suck We broke up, got back together We both thought we had forever Not bad people, just bad together We were so nuts Backstab each other Another blow struck But there's no ducking this blow Cause it's over And it's closure But, I'm not so sure how to close this I just don't know how some people could be so good at one thing and so fucked at another It's no wonder. How come you can be a lord of illusion How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father? A good dad, but a bad husband Why are you a good father? A great dad, but a bad husband (dad) (you said) Forever be a hero in my eyes I reply But there's always another side to a good father A great dad, but a bad husband",4061,en,

Bad Meets Evil,https://www.metrolyrics.com/bad-meets-evil-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"I reckon you ain't familiar with these here parts You know, there's a story behind that there saloon Twenty years ago, two outlaws took this whole town over Sheriffs couldn't stop 'em Quickest damn gun-slingers I've ever seen Got murdered in cold-blood That old saloon there was their little ""home away from home"" They say the ghosts of Bad and Evil still live in that tavern And on a quiet night You can still hear the footsteps of Slim Shady and Royce da 5'9"". I don't speak, I float in the air wrapped in a sheet I'm not a real person, I'm a ghost trapped in a beat I translate when my voice is read through a seismograph And a noise is spread, picked up and transmitted through Royce's head Trap him in his room, possess him and hoist his bed Till the evilness flows through his blood like poisonous lead Told him each one of his boys is dead I asked him to come to the dark side. He made a choice and said. Who hard? Yo I done heard worse We can get in two cars and accelerate at each other To see which one'll swerve first Two blind bandits panic whose mental capacity holds That of a globe on top of nine other planets Kissed the cheek of the Devil Intelligence level is hellier than treble peaking on speakers in the ghetto Dismissal, I'm not a fair man Disgraced the race of an atheist Intercepting missiles with my bare hands like a patriot One track sliced without swords I buried the Christ corpse In my past life when the black knight mounted the white horse. And stay over-worked, it's like the Nazis and the Nation collaborating attempting to take over the Earth. 'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people. He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal Above the law cause I don't agree with police either Shit, me neither We ain't eager to be legal So please leave me with the keys to your Jeep Eagle I breathe ether in three lethal amounts While I stab myself in the knee with a diseased needle Releasing rage on anybody in squeezing range Cold enough to make the seasons change into freezing rain. He's insane No I'm not, I just want to shoot up and I'm pissed off Cause I can't find a decent vein. The disaster with dreads I'm bad enough to commit suicide And survive long enough to kill my soul after I'm dead When in danger, it's funny, actually my flavor's similar to a waiter 'Cause I serve any stranger with money I spray a hundred, man until they joint chains While slipping bullets at point-blank range like they was punches Piss on a flag and burn it, murder you then come to your funeral Service lobby and strangle your body to confirm it Whipping human ass, throwing blows, cracking jaws With my fists wrapped in gauze, dipped in glue and glass. I'm blazing MCs, at the same time amazing MCs Somehow, MCs ain't that eyebrow-raising to me From all of angles of us, flash a Mack loud enough To cast a avalanche and bust till volcanoes erupt. Hello? Ayo, what's up? We're coming to get you!. Stop! They know it's us!. I used to be a loudmouth, remember me? I'm the one who burned your house down, well I'm out now. And this time I'm coming back to blow your house up And I ain't gon' leave you a window to jump out of Give me two fat tabs and three 'shrooms. And you won't see me like fat people in steam rooms And when I go to Hell and I'm getting ready to leave I'ma put air in a bag and charge people to breathe. 'Cause this is what happens when Bad meets Evil And we hit the trees till we look like Vietnamese people He's Evil, and I'm Bad like Steve Seagal Against peaceful, see you in hell for the sequel. We'll be waiting See you in Hell Wall Street, Royce Da 5'9"", Slim Shady See you in hell for the sequel Bad Meets Evil, what Till next time. And so that's the story when Bad meets Evil Two of the most wanted individuals in the county Made Jesse James and Billy the Kid look like law-abiding citizens It's too bad they had to go out the way they did Got shot in the back coming out of that old saloon But their spirits still live on till this day Shhh...

Beautiful Pain,https://www.metrolyrics.com/beautiful-pain-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"I can feel the heat rising Everything is on fire Today is a painful reminder of why We can only get brighter The further you put it behind ya And right now I'm on the inside Lookin' out, 'cause. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. Yesterday was the tornado warning Today is like the morning after Your world is torn in half, you wake And let's wait to start the morning process Rebuilding and you're still a work in progress Today is a whole new chapter, it's like an enormous ass The thunderstorm has passed ya Your weather didn't poke his eyes out With the thorn bush that you Used to smell the roses, stopped to inhale Can't even tell your nose is stuffed So focused on the brightside, then you floor The gas pedal, and hit the corner fast The more asserted, never looking back May hit the curb But everyday is a new learning curve As you, steer through life Sometimes you might not wanna swerve But you have to, to avert a disaster Lucky, no permanent damage 'Cause they hurt you so bad It's like they murdered your ass And threw dirt on your casket But you returned from the ashes And that hurt that you have, you just converted to gasoline And while you're burning the past Standing at inferno and chant. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. So familiarize With what having to swallow this pill is like It happens all the time, they take your heart And steal your life And it's as though you feel you've died Because you've been killed inside But yet you're still alive which means You will survive Although today you may weep because you're weak and Everything seems so bleak and hopeless The light that you're seeking, it begins to seep in That's the only thing keepin' you From leapin' off the motherfreaking deep in And I'm pulling for you to push through this feeling And with a little time that should do the healin' And by tomorrow you may even feel so good That you're willing To forgive them even after All that shit you been put through This feeling of resilience is building And the flames are burning Quick as fire would through this building You're sealed in But your fireproof and retardant you withstood it And as you climb up to the roof You're just chillin' and you look down 'Cause you're so over them you could Put the heel of your foot through the ceiling. As time passes, things change everyday But wounds? Wounds heal But scars still remaining the same But tomorrow today's gone down in flames Throw the match at the passed up place. So feel the fire beneath your feet As you barely even perspire from the heat Exhale deep and breathe a sigh of relief And as you say goodbye to the grief It's like watching the walls melt In your prison cell But you've extinguished this living hell Still a little piece of you dies, you scream. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. I feel the burn, watch the smoke as I turn rising A phoenix from the flames Flame of love, we're going to fight the word, fight Now it feels with these wings that I will fly. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light. I standing in the flames There's a beautiful kind of pain Setting fire to yesterday Find the light, find the light, find the light:",3914,en,
Believe,https://www.metrolyrics.com/believe-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"And I, started from the, bottom Like a, snowman, ground up Like round chuck, still put hands on you Staying wound up is how I spend time Sucker free, confidence high Such a breeze when I pin rhymes I just got the air about me Like wind chimes (yeah) Another day in the life (uh) Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah) Now my community is gated And I made it, and my neighbors say hi (say hi) I'm giving them pounds, I'm upscale now Guess it means I'm way in the sky. But I still remember the days of, minimal wage for General labor, welfare recipients is a minor Look at how government assistance has made ya Adversity, if at first if you don't succeed Put your temper to more use 'cause being broke is a poor excuse That shit only gives you more fuel Show them why you're you So close, God, it's like I almost got it. But close only counts in timebombs and horseshoes So I uni-bomb shit (tick, tick, tick) No remorse Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick That's why they call me firecracker I grew up on wick (wick, wick, wick) with a short fuse I got some important news to report to Anyone who thought I was done, nah, bitch, not quite Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours? Do you still believe In me?. Didn't I get everything I had to give you to make you see? I never forget if you turn your back on me Now and walk out I will never let you live it down (I never quit) Do you still believe? In me?. Man I know sometimes these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice To me, there's just ink blots I just fling them like slingshots, and so precise So you might want to think it over twice When you retards can roll the dice But beef will at least cost you your career 'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced. But this middle finger is free as a bird New warhead-ed birth, you just forehead-ed on earth Too short for a verse, studied his formula Learned how to incorporate a curse Point it towards corporate America Stick a fork in it and turn 'Cause four-letter words are more better Heard the world force-fed a turd to me You're getting yours. But sometimes I overdo it But I just get so into it I was there consoling you when no one knew it When your situation showed no improvement I was that door, you walked over to it I'm the light at the end of tunnel so people are always looking at me as they're going through it. When that tunnel vision is unclear, shit becomes too much to bear Since ""Cleaning Out My Closet"" when I was having trouble with the snare I'm that unrealistic prayer answered And I'ma get you jacked up, like you're trying to fix a flat (uh), when you struggle with a spare That double fisted bear, knuckles coupled with this pair of nuts I'm cupping I am your fucking switch, nothing can compare. Do you still believe In me? Didn't I get everything I had to give you to make you see? I never forget if you turn your back on me Now and walk out I will never let you live it down (I never quit) Do you still believe? In me?.

Motivation to go, Hussein with the flow Fake fans with the two-faced that show Let heartbeats loot, produce hate in my soul Laying vocals two days in a row True statement, hate to go down this road But there's only one route to cross this bridge So I walk in this bitch with loose chains 'Cause all my dues paid But this booth is taking its toll. But it's never too late to start a new beginning That goes for you too So what the fuck are you gonna do, use the tools you're given? Or are you going to use the cards you were dealt as an excuse for you to not do shit with them I used to play the loser victim Until I saw the way Proof was driven. I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets Fanny packs, hourglasses If time was still on my side, I'd still have none to waste Man, in my younger days, that dream was so much fun to chase It's like I ran in place while this shit dangled in front of my face. But how do you keep up the pace and the hunger pangs once you've won the race When that pool of exhaust is cooling off 'Cause you don't got nothing left to prove at all 'Cause you done already hit them with the coup de grÃ¢ce Still you feel the need To go through and deal with that Bruce Willis That blue steel, that truth still When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will Do you still believe?",4701,en,

Alright, listen, I need you to focus I need you to go dig deep in your mind; this is important We are going to perform an experiment of the sorts I'm going to have to ask you to bear with me for a moment Now, I need you to open your mind; your eyes, close them You are now about to be placed under my hypnosis For the next four and a half minutes We are going to explore into your mind To find out why you're so fucking jealous Now, why did they make Yoo-hoo? Hippity ga-ga boo-boo Psych, I'm kidding I just wanted to see if you're still listenin' Okay, now I need your undivided attention Sir, I have a question Why do I always sense this undeniable tension?

Here's a mirror; notice the resemblance here? Wait, let me put these sunglasses on Now look in this mirror; how about now? What do you have in common? You're both green with envy and look like idiots with sunglasses on 'em You look like I sound like, singing about weenies Now take my weenie out of your mouth This is between me and you; I know you're not happy I know you'd much rather see me lying in the corner of a room somewhere crying Curled up in a ball, tweaked out of my mind, dying There is no denying that my weenie is much bigger than yours is. Mine is like sticking a banana between two oranges Why're you even doing this to yourself? It's pointless Why do we have to keep on going through this?

Brain damage, ever since the day I was born Drugs is what they used to say I was on They say I never knew which way I was goin'. But everywhere I go they keep playin' my song Brain damage. Way before my baby daughter Hailey I was harassed daily by this fat kid named D'Angelo Bailey An eighth grader who acted obnoxious, 'cause his father boxes So everyday he'd shove me in the lockers One day he came in the bathroom while I was pissin' And had me in the position to beat me into submission He banged my head against the urinal till he broke my nose Soaked my clothes in blood, grabbed me and choked my throat I tried to plead and tell him ""We shouldn't beef"" But he just wouldn't leave, he kept chokin' me and I couldn't breathe He looked at me and said ""You gonna die honkey!"" The principal walked in and started helpin' him stomp me I made them think they beat me to death Holdin' my breath for like five minutes before they finally left Then I got up and ran to the janitor's storage booth Kicked the door hinge loose and ripped out the four inch screws Grabbed some sharp objects, brooms, and foreign tools ""This is for every time you took my orange juice"" ""Or stole my seat in the lunchroom and drank my chocolate milk"" ""Every time you tipped my tray and it dropped and spilt"" ""I'm gettin' you back bully!"" ""Now once and for good"" I cocked the broomstick back and swung hard as I could. And beat him over the head with it till I broke the wood Knocked him down, stood on his chest with one foot Made it home, later that same day Started reading a comic and suddenly everything became gray I couldn't even see what I was tryin' to read. I went deaf, and my left ear started to bleed My mother started screamin' ""What are you on, drugs?"" ""Look at you, you're gettin' blood all over my rug!"". She beat me over the head with the remote control Opened a hole, and my whole brain fell out of my skull I picked it up and screamed ""Look bitch, what have you done!?"" ""Oh my God! I'm sorry son!"" ""Shut up you cunt!"" I said ""Fuck it!"" Took it and stuck it back up in my head Then I sewed it shut and put a couple of screws in my neck.

Perhaps a frontal lobotomy would be the answer If science can operate on this distorted brain and put it to good use Society will reap a great benefit. I walk around like a space cadet, place your bets Who's likely to become a serial killer? Case of tourette's Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Can't take the stress. I make a mess as the day progresses. Angry and take it out on the neighbours hedges Like this is how I'll cut your face up bitches with these hedge trimming scisors with razor edges Imagination's dangerous, it's the only way to escape this mess and make the best of this situation, I guess 'Cause I feel like a little bitch's, predicaments, despicable I'm sick of just getting pushed, it's ridiculous I look like a freaking wuss, a pussy This kid just took my stick of liquorice and threw my sticker books in a picker bush I wanna kick his toosh, but I was six and shook. This fucker was 12 and was 6 foot, with a vicious hook He hit me, I fell, I got back up, all I did was book, now there's using your head. Mama always said ""If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"" A brain you'd be dangerous (Mama could be wrong) Mama, I'ma grow a name and be famous And I'mma be a pain in the anus (Mama could be wrong). I'mma use my head as a weapon Find a way to escape this insaneness. (Mama always said). ""Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"" Guess it pays to be brainless. Fast forward some years later: a teenager This is a fun, sweet! I just got jumped twice in one week, it's complete. It's usually once a month, this is some feat I've accomplished They've stomped me into the mud for what reason, you stomped me But how do you get the shit beat out of you, be down and be upbeat When you don't have no-thing, no valid shot at life Chance to make it or succeed 'cause you're doomed from the start. It's like you grew up on drug street, from jump street But if I had just kept my head up my ass I could accomplish any task, practicing trash talking in a trance Locked in my room, yeah but I got some plans mama These damn rhymes are falling out of my pants pocket, I can't stop it And I'm starting to blend in more, school, this shit helps for sure I'm getting more self assured than I've ever been before Plus no one picks on me anymore, I done put a stop to that Threw my first punch, end of story Still in my skulls a vacant, empty void Been using it more as a bin for storage Take some inventory and as gorge as a Ford engine door hinge syringe an orange an extension cord and a Ninja sword. Not to mention four lynch pins and a stringent stored ironing board a bench a wrench or winch and a tangent whore Everything but a brain, but dome's off the fucking chain Like an independent store, something's wrong with my head Just think if I had a brain in it, thank God that I don't 'Cause I'd probably be dahmer 'Cause mama always said. ""If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"" A brain you'd be dangerous (Mama could be wrong) Mama, I'ma grow a name and be famous. And I'mma be a pain in the anus (Mama could be wrong). I'mma use my head as a weapon Find a way to escape this insaneness. (Mama always said) ""Son, If you had a brain, you'd be dangerous"" Guess it pays to be brainless. Now my mom goes ""womp, womp, womp"" 'Cause I'm not that smart but I'm not dumb I was on a bottom of the pile getting stomped. But somehow, I came out on top. I told you one day, I said they'd have that red carpet rolled out, yo I'm nice, yo, fuck it I'm out cold. Now everywhere I go, they scream out ""Go!"" I'm 'bout to clean house, yo I'm Lysol, now I'm just household Outsold the sell outs, freak the hell out Middle America, hear them yell out They were so scared, and those kids Just about, belted out, whatever spout that it fell out Of my smart alleck mouth, it was so weird Inappropriate, so be it, I don't see it Maybe one day when the smoke clears, it won't be as Motherfuckin' difficult, ch'yea, till then Hopefully you little homos get over your fears and grow beards It's okay to be scared straight, they said I provoke queers Till emotions evoke tears, my whole careers a stroke of sheer genius Smoke and mirrors, tactical, practical jokes, yeah. You motherfuckin' - insert insult here - Who the fuck would've thunk that one little lone MC would be able to take the whole culture and re-upholstery it And boy they did flock, can't believe this little hick locked This Hip-Hop shit in his pocket and still the shit got that white trash traffic and gridlock Shit happened like a six blocks from a Kid Rock Insane Clown Posse concert in mid Oc-tober And got forbid I see a wizard and get a brain in my titanium cranium dog 'Cause I turn into the unabomber.

Who'd a knew the pew'd a do to me what it's done? Such sin-a-sism when it isn't in my system. Blunt-igmatism betta spliff up to my lips son, So much on my hands, I gotta give my kids a fist-bump.

Women, skinnin them and cuttin them up in chunks, In clumps - the woman with cocoa-butter skin once.. Once again they call me Buffalo Bill, Buffalo Bill, Buffa-Buffalo Bill.

Bully,https://www.metrolyrics.com/bully-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Yo, check it out, it's fucked up. And I don't see either one of us budging. I'm with holding my anger Though I'd like to be the strangler. Of this punk ass little pussy's puny neck It's my right to insist That he acknowledge my existence But he just displays complete lack of respect That's what he says to himself. As he uses magazines to trash me As he sits with both feet up at his desk Smokes a bag of his weed And starts imagining things And he just can't see that he's manically depressed. And in his jealousy and envy It just whirls him in a frenzy As he turns on MTV and sees my face He don't exist in this world So he just twists and he twirls. Spirals and spins till he hurls himself into rage And it's destroying him slowly Cause he does not even know me Even though he sees me everywhere he goes So he just tortures himself. He has no fortune and wealth So he extorts someone else, to get his dough And now he's acting like a bully So he tries to push and pull me But he knows that he can't fool me so he's mad He has no choice but to scream. And raise his voice up at me Cause it annoys him to see, that I ain't scared You ain't no motherfucking (bully) And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully). I won't allow it, ain't gonna coward to no (bully). I'll be damn if I don't stand up to a (bully). Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully) And I know it must be fucking with you emotionally (bully) Now I'm not trying to make no more enemies No more unfortunately There's so many other motherfuckers that just are They just keep pounding at me Now that I'm down with 50 Suddenly now I got beef, with this faggot Ja' But his ass is such a puppet Irv could shove his whole hand up it And just make him say what he wants him to say But Suge has Irv's on a string. And Irv's so nervous that he Says anything to this man, to keep him at bay So now Ja thinks that he's so tough And Murder Inc.'s the big bad wolf And they go huff and puff and blow our label down But our building's made out of bricks. So you ain't taking out shit And dawg you just did a song, with Bobby Brown So now you try to pull a race card And it backfires in your face hard Cause you know we don't play that black and white shit Plus this stylist that you fucked. When you was ecstasied up Was just a man who's dressed up, as a white bitch You ain't no motherfucking (bully) And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully). I won't allow it, ain't gonna coward to no (bully). I'll be damn if I don't stand up to a (bully). Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully). You must be taking to much (bully) Now what bothers me the most About hip-hop is we so close To picking up where we left off with Big and Puck We just lost Jam Master J Big L got blasted away. Plus we lost Bugs, Slang Toungue, and Freaky Ta It's like a never-ending cycle That just seems to come full circle Everybody's gotta be so fucking hard I'm not excluding myself Cause I been stupid as well. I been known to lose it when someone says something smart But as we grow as men We learn to let shit go, but then again There's only so much bullshit we can really stand We all got reps to uphold When someone steps on our toes It's no exception, it goes for every man But if Irv really gave a fuck About Ja like he claims he does He'd wake him up and make his boy get off them drugs But he just keeps feeding him pills So if that E doesn't kill him Someone from G-Unit will and I ain't buzzed Dawg I'm talking to you straight If the situation escalates Anyworse we're gonna lose another soldier to this game And if I get killed for this rap I got a million in cash That says I will get you back in Halie's name You ain't no motherfucking (bully) And I ain't bowing to no motherfucking (bully) I won't allow it, ain't gonna coward to no (bully) I'll be damn if I don't stand up to a (bully) Fight like a man and throw my hands up to a (bully) Irvine get your boyed off that (bully) Get at me, dawg Holla",3970,en,

The Rock Hudson of rock 'cause who would have thought this much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter?. That was for 50. Little slap on the wrist, be warned I'm unravelin' quickly My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles like what happened to Chris Reeve's spine column That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles And why I haven't come back on these faggots who diss me is more of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel!. But my patience is wearing thin Swear I been contemplatin' rubbing shit in your face 'til I smear it in Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen and never appear again if you actually had fuckin' careers to end. But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them.... Molly, I'm gone off you Man, light some kush You're my first take, I'll nail you Can't lie, I gush If I won you over, you would be the grand prize I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push You can get it in the can like some Anheuser Busch Jeans too small, least three pant sizes Tush mushed against your damn side, your puss and thighs are squished What kind of attire's that? I'm ready to be rode Psychopath, bet you we'll get it poppin' like a flat. Light the match to ignite the wrath Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in half Piper Chapman might just have to picket me like a scab. Hard to describe in fact Startling, violent, perhaps are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that And you aren't really surprised at that, but as far as these lines I rap, and these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69'ed the track.

Careful What You Wish For,https://www.metrolyrics.com/careful-what-you-wish-for-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Breaking News: Detroit Rapper Eminem cancels his sold out European tour to check himself into rehab, after admitting an addiction to sleep medication. We'll have more on this story as it develops... Shady Records recording artist Obie Trice has apparently survived a gunshot to the head, in what appears to be a random drive by shooting, meanwhile Eminem is rumored to be... On-and-off-again relationship with... This just in, a tour bus involving Eminem's... Updating a story we brought to you earlier about gunfire at an after hours club, we've learned that the rapper Proof has been fatally shot... Shady Aftermath recording artist... Long time best friend of Eminem and a member of the rap group D12... D12 back in the news again today... Is it a sabbatical or the end? The rumors and speculation continue to swirl around Eminem; he insists he's just taking a break, but now its believed hes retiring, leaving us all to ask: Will the Real Slim Shady please stand up? So this is it... This is what I wished for. Just isn't how I envisioned it. Fame to the point of imprisonment. I just thought the shit'd be different But something changed The minute that I got a whiff of it I started to inhale it Smell it Started sniffin' it And it became my cocaine I just couldn't quit I just wanted a little bit Then it turned me (in)to a monster I became a hypocrite Concert after concert I was raking in the dough Rolling in green Had the game hemmed up Like a sewing machine But I was losing my freedom There was no where for me To not go and be seen And just go and be me And there was no in-between You either loved it or hate it. Every CD critics gave it a 3, then 3 Years later, they'd go back and re-rate it. And call the Slim Shady LP the greatest The Marshall Mathers was a classic The Eminem Show was fantastic But Encore just didn't have the caliber to match it. I guess enough time just ain't passed, yet. A couple more years, that shit'll be ill-matic And eight years later, I'm still at it. Divorce, re-married. A felon A father Sleeping pill addict. And this is real talk I feel like the Incredible Hulk My back has been broke, and I can still walk So be Careful What You Wish For 'Cause you just might get it. And if you get it then you just might not know What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just Come back on you ten-fold I said Be Careful What You Wish For. 'Cause you just might get it. And if you get it then you just might not know What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just Come back on you ten-fold I got a letter from a fan, that said He's been praying for me. Every day and for some reason It's been weighing on my mind heavy 'Cause I don't read every Letter I get, but something told me to go ahead and open it, but Why would someone pray for you when they don't know you? You didn't pray for me when I was local And as I lay these vocals I think of all the shit I had to go through Just to get to where I'm at I've already told you at least A thousand times in these rhymes I appreciate the prayer, but I've already got God on my side And it's been one hell of a ride, hasn't it? Just watchin' it from an opposite standpoint Man, boy's got to look. Nuts And that's the only word I can think of right now On how To describe the shit This is like a vibe you get Go ahead and bob to it Just watch what you wish for, 'cause I got the shit So be Careful What You Wish For 'Cause you just might get it And if you get it then you just might not know What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just Come back on you ten-fold I said Be Careful What You Wish For 'Cause you just might get it And if you get it then you just might not know What to do wit' it, 'cause it might just Come back on you ten-fold",3707,en,

I never meant to make you cry; but tonight I'm comin' out my closet. Ha!

So you can try but can't deny the way you treated me MA? But guess what?

Because I need you Like a fish needs the sea Like a fire needs oxygen Like a flower needs a bee And if you really care for me You'd let me video you while you wee. Standing up in the bath,  I shouldn't even have to ask Perhaps you'll even store  a little more in a flask These are just the things that people do When their love for one another is true Ba da da. We go together Like a cracker and Brie Like racism and ignorance Like bling and R&B But if you really want to show you care You'd let me wear your underwear When we visit your mum's,  it's a bit of harmless fun I just like talking about your childhood  with some lace between my buns There's no reason for a big to-do If your love for one another is true Ba da da. We go together Like a bird in a nest Like Internet and porn Like guns and the US And if you love me  like you say that you do You'd purchase forty cockatoo And teach them to fly in formation in the sky And shit the words ""Tim is God""  on my ex-girlfriend's Hyundai Sure, it might be easier with doves But shirking challenges is not what love. Is all about Love is not all wine and roses Sometimes it's handcuffs and cheese No-one said love is for free And if you agree with that You'll sing me passages from the Koran  wearing nothing but a Bob the Builder hat To the tune of waltzing Matilda I just love the combination of Islam, nationalism and builder. (Builder) (Islam) (Nationalism) (And a little bitty builder) (Islam) (Ozzy Ozzy Ozzy) (And Bob the fucking Builder). Because I need you Like a tick needs a tock Like bananas need pyjamas Like a nun needs cock But if you want to put your love for me first You wouldn't go through childbirth You'd agree to adopt  so that you could stay thin We'll get a Chinese kid,  it could teach us Mandarin And communists don't make as much noise And they're really good  at sharing their toys. Because I dig you Like an Aussie digs pies Like Born-Agains dig Jesus Like Jesus dug guys. And if you love me unconditionally You'd do my tax return for me Cos it's way overdue,  and I just don't know, I guess I'm self-employed  but do I still pay as I go? And does the threshold apply to me? And should I register for GST And if you love me unconditionally Would you let me video you while you wee?

Crazy In Love,https://www.metrolyrics.com/crazy-in-love-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Tell myself that I was doing alright There's nothing left to do tonight I go crazy on you, crazy on you. Lemme go crazy, crazy on you Can't you see what you do to me baby?. You make me crazy, you make me act like a maniac I'm like a lunatic, you make me sick. You're truly the only one who can do this to me You just make me get so crazy I go schizo, I get so insane I just go skitzophrenic One minute I want to slit your throat, the next I wanna sex. You make me crazy, the way we act like two maniacs in the sack We fuck like two jackrabbits and maybe that's a bad habit 'Cuz the next day we're right back at it in the same exact pattern What the fuck is the matter with us, we can't figure out if it's lust. Or it's love what's that that's attracting us to each other They say that every man grows up to marry his own mother Which would explain why you're such a motherfucking bitch But I stay and still stick it out with you even though I just hit you today. But you deserve it you hit me first and provoked me to choke you Just 'cuz I came home late last night crawled in bed and I woke you But if there's one thing about you that I admire it's baby Because you stay with me, maybe, 'cuz you're as crazy as I am. 'Cuz when I look at you I can see an angel in your eyes But if I look deeper inside I see your freakish little side Like a devil in disguise, you're always full of surprises Always pullin' devices out your purse, little vibrators. And dildos, you fuck yourself so much, you barely feel those anymore You're only 24 but you're plenty more ma- -ture than those other little hoes who just act like little girls Like they're in middle school, still you're crazy sexy cool, chillin'. You play your position, you never step out of line Even though I stay in your business, you've always kept out of mine I wonder what's on your mind sometimes They say love is blind. Maybe that's why the first time I dotted your eye You ain't see the sign Or maybe you did, maybe you like being shoved Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love. I go crazy on you, crazy on you Lemme go crazy, crazy on you You are the ink to my paper what my pen is to my pad The moral, the very fiber the whole substance to my rap. You are my reason for being, the meaning of my existence If it wasn't for you I would never be able to spit this As intense as I do and the irony is you rely on me as much As I rely on you to inspire me like you do. You provide me the lighter-fluid the fuel my fire You're my entire supply gas, the match, and igniter The only way that I am able to stay so stable is you're the legs To my table, if you were to break I'd fall on my face. But I am always gonna make you feel I don't need you As much as I really need you so you don't use it to your advantage But you are essential to me, you are the air I breathe I believe if you ever leave me, I'd probably have no reason to be You are the Kim to my Marshall, you are the Slim to my Shady The Dre to my Eminem, the Alaina to my Hailie You are the word that I am looking for when I'm trying to describe How I feel inside and the right one just won't come to my mind You're like the pillar that props me up, the beam that supports me The bitch who never took half, the wife who never divorced me You are like the root to my evil You let my devil come out me You let me beat the shit out you Before you beat the shit out me And no matter how much too much is never enough Maybe 'cuz were crazy in love I go crazy on you, crazy on you Lemme go crazy, crazy on you",3510,en,

This is my dance song Can you hear me? Alright, ay turn my headphones up. My favorite color is red, like the blood shed from Kurt Cobain's head when he shot himself dead Women all grabbin' at my shish-kabob Bought Lauryn Hill's tape so her kids could starve You thought I was ill and now I'm even more so Shit I got full-blown AIDS and a sore throat I got a wardrobe with an orange robe I'm in the fourth row, signin' autographs at your show I just remembered that I'm absent-minded Wait, I mean I've lost my mind, I can't find it I'm freestylin' every verse that I spit 'Cause I don't even remember the words to my shit I told the doc I need a change in sickness And gave a girl herpes in exchange for syphilis Put my LP on your Christmas gift list You want to get high?

Cum on everybody Get down tonight. Cum on everybody Get down tonight. Cum on everybody Get down tonight. Cum on everybody Get down tonight. Yo, yo, yo! I tried suicide once and I'll try it again That's why I write songs where I die at the end 'Cause I don't give a fuck, like my middle finger was stuck And I was wavin' it at everybody screaming ""I suck"" I go on stage in front of a sellout crowd and yell out loud ""All y'all get the hell out now"" Fuck rap, I'm givin' it up y'all, I'm sorry ""But Eminem this is your record release party!"" I'm bored out of my gourd So I took a hammer and nailed my foot to the floorboard of my Ford Guess I'm just a sick sick bastard Who's one sandwich short of a picnic basket One Excedrin tablet short of a full medicine cabinet I feel like my head has been shredded like lettuce and cabbage And if you ever see a video for this shit I'll probably be dressed up like a mummy with my wrists slit. Cum on everybody Get down tonight. Cum on everybody Get down tonight. Cum on everybody Get down tonight. Cum on everybody Get down tonight. Cum on everybody Get down tonight. Cum on everybody Get down tonight. Cum on everybody Get down tonight. Cum on everybody Get down tonight. Got bitches on my jock out in East Detroit Cause they think that I'm a mothafuckin' Beastie Boy So I told 'em I was Mike D They was like ""Gee, I don't know, he might be!"" I told 'em ""Meet me at Kid Rock's next concert"" ""I'll be standin' by the Loch Ness Monster"" ""Peace out"", then I jetted to the weed house Smoked out till I started bustin' freestyles Broke out then I dipped quick back to the crib, put on lipstick Crushed up the Tylenol and ate it with a dipstick Made a couple of crank calls collect ""It's Ken Kaniff from Connecticut, can you accept?"" I want to make songs all the fellas dub And murder every rich rapper that I'm jealous of So just remember when I bomb your set Yo, I only cuss to make your mom upset.

Brains underwear? A pantywaist, Classic case of disfunction Aggravated assault, it was rap related, you activated a gunman This game's oversaturated with junk and you punks couldn't get a hit from a database with a thumbprint Razors and matches, path is laid for destruction Put Jason Mraz's face in his ass then I'm snatchin' Anne Hathaway, she scratchin' like Jam Master Jay on the one's and Two's, I slash away then I'm dumpin' her ass in a Lake Placid for Alligators After I use the fuckin' tire thumper to bash her brains in for nothin' The murder weapons I stash 'em away on Runyon Man the kind of balls that it has to take and the gumption Lack of class displayed but such a vast array in abundance Of sad disgraceful and bad distasteful redundance And bitch I'm hung like candy canes if you're wondering Balls come at you like batting cages, I'm raw like Big Daddy Kane is, I'm coming Like I'm ejaculating and nutting, come catch the clap like you're patty caking little dumpling Or brace yourself like a cast and be the last to make an assumption I'm back Like I'm in the bathroom taking a dump and it's back in the day or somethin' I'll shit on you, devil's night, how's that for a introduction?",2042,en,

You fuckin' just left me here do die didn't you? Why didn't you responded yet? I've written you five or six different times and I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you I didn't do, shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through This couldn't be true, we can't be over So Violets are blue, roses are red Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?.

Just so you don't die alone Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you So I'm findin' something the matter with them Excuse to not see anyone Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol I get bowled like bowling balls No calls and know to call to talk, forget what I want to say Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains Like birthday cake candles Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake Can't escape the madness. Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song But I can't even change the station. The same one's playin' on eight channels I lay awake in shambles I'm startin to hallucinate. And I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light. Saw my old sweetheart she said ""honey, I'm back"" Just so you don't die alone. Just so you don't die alone Give me one more, bottle for the pain Give me one more for the memories Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak It'll help alleviate. It'll soothe this ache Of trying to fake That she's really, she's really coming back And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love I'm still with in denial now, dealing with the finality of it And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent And how I'll never hold you again And there ain't shit I can do about it, now my head is overcrowded With these tired memories and I can't seem to get you out it. And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably Knowing what you done did to me, huh? Did it even occur to you that I loved you, huh? Complete, madly, head over heels for you Was you and me, wants us to be together forever It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointing toward the light Saw my old sweetheart she said ""honey, I'm back"" Just so you don't die alone Just so you don't die alone",3241,en,

Nope But I hope I offended you when I told ya how dope I am at this And put emphasis on the ""dope,"" so when names come up In that conversation of who's the dopest, better throw mine in it And don't mind me, while I remind you of the flow You won't find anywhere, when it fires and I unload my pen explodes 'til there's no rhymes in it, reload in no time Let insults fly every sixty seconds that go by, so you know I meant it In school I was so shy, timid Two pairs of jeans I'd alternate, bummy clothes, I 'member Begging my mom for K-Mart MacGregors cause they were new St. Vincent de Paul, those Pony's were used, and no size fitted But kissed them old days, adios, I did it They said I was a gimmick, now I'm the one that those guys mimic Now you fuckers don't wanna go starting no argument Cause you know I'll win it, name a flow that's more authentic, and don't front You know I got you open, kid, don't front You know I got you open, word, don't front You know I got you open, kid, yo why you fronting?

Never asked you like my shit from the get I'd rather ask you to wipe my ass, bitch You had you a nice run, now take a hike I ever meet my match, I'mma strike that bitch first Cause on the mic I gotta represent the real rappers The real rappers get their mothafuckin' skills cracking Word to Buckshot and Dru-Ha, why the fuck not?

I'm in a strange place I feel like Ma$e when he gave up the game for his faith I feel like I'm caged in these chains and restraints Grimming every stranger in the place while I gaze into space 'Cause I'm mentally rearranging his face I need a change of pace 'cause the pace I'm working at is dangerous There's nowhere to dump this anger and thanks to this angst I done quit chicken heads cold turkey and started slowly roasting 'em 'Cause that's where most of my anger is baste Fuck your feelings, I feel like I play for the Saints I just want to hurt you, aim for the skanks Then aim for all these fake Kanyes, Jays, Waynes and the Drakes I'm frustrated cause ain't no more N'Sync, now I'm all out of whack I'm all out of Backstreet Boys to call out and attack I'm going all out in this rap shit and whatever the fallout is I'm strapped for battles sucka Duck, crawl out the back, it's a bar fight Prepare your arsenal and beware of bar stools Flying through the air and bottles breaking, mirrors also And I ain't stopping till the swear jar's full ""You done called every woman a slut"" ""But you're forgetting Sarah, Marshall"" (Palin!) Oh, my bad... Slut And next time I show to in court I'll be naked and just wear a lawsuit Judge be like ""That's sharp, how much did that motherfucker cost you?"" ""Smart-ass, you're lucky I don't tear it off you"" ""And jump your bones, you sexy motherfucker"" ""You're so fucking gravy, Marshall I should start calling you au jus"" ""Cause all you do is spit them lyrics out the wazoo"" Evil twin, take this beat now, it's all you I believe people can change, but only for the worse I could've changed the world if it wasn't for this verse So satanic, K-Mart chains panic 'Cause they can't even spin back the curse words Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker (Rape your mother, kill your parents) And these kids are like parrots, they run around the house just like terrorists Screaming, ""fuck, shit, fuck"" adult with a childish-like arrogance Wild ever since the day I came out I was like, merits Fuck that, I'd rather be loud and I like swearing From thr first album even the gals were like ""Tight lyrics, dreamy eyes"". But my fucking mouth was nightmare-ish. And from the start of it you felt like you were part of this and opposition felt the opposite. Sometimes I listen and revisit them old albums often as I can and skim through all them bitches. To make sure I keep up with my competition. Hogger of beats, hoarder of rhymes Borderline genius who's bored of his lines. And that sort of defines. Where I'm at And the way I feel now, feel like I might just strike first and ignore the replies. There's darkness closing in, there it goes again. It controls my pen, but that ain't me, it's my evil twin But he's just a friend, who pops up now and again. So don't blame me, just blame him, it's my evil twin. Welcome back to the land of the living, my friend You have slept for quite some time. So who's left, Lady Gaga? Mess with the Bieber Nah, F with Christina, I ain't fucking with either Jessica neither Simpson or Alba, my albums just sicker than strep with the fever Get the Cloriseptic, Excedrin, Aleve or Extra Strength Tylenol 3's, feel like I'm burning to death but I'm freezing Bed ridden and destined never to leave the Bedroom ever again like the legend of Heath-uh- Ledger, my suicide notes, barely legible read the Bottom, it's signed by the Joker, Lorena said I never can leave her She'd sever my wiener I ever deceive her Fuck that shit, bitch! Give up my dick for pussy? I'd be Jerry Mathers, I ever left it to Beaver Get them titties cut off trying to mess with a cleaver Golly-wally, I vent, heat register, Jesus Ever since 1-9-9-4-6 Dresden, it was definitely my Destiny when on the steps, I met DeShaun At Osborn, I'd never make it to sophomore I just wanted to skip school and rap, used to mop floors Flip burgers and wash dishes, while I wrote rhymes trying to get props for 'em Cause I took book-smarts and swapped for 'em They were sleeping, I made 'em stop snorin' Made them break out the popcorn Now I've been hip-hop in it's tip-top form Since N.W.A was blaring through my car windows leaning on the horn Screaming ""Fuck the police"" like cop porn Flipped rap on its ear Like I dropped corn Fuck top five, bitch, I'm top four And that includes Biggie and Pac, whore And I got an Evil Twin, so who the fuck do you think that third and that fourth spot's for? And crazy as I am I'm much tamer than him And I'm nuts, then again who the fuck wants a plain Eminem? But no one's insaner than Slim, look at that (evil grin) (Evil twin) please come in, what was your name again? Hi! Faggot Look who's back with a crab up his ass Like a lobster crawled up there Two rabbits, a koala bear and a ball of hair And you're all aware I don't got it all upstairs Guess that's why I'm an addict and it's so small up there Peace to Whitney, jeez, just hit me That I should call the Looney Police to come get me 'Cause I'm so sick of being the truth, I wish someone finally admit me To a mental hospital with Britney Oh! LMFAO Oh, no way, Jo- Se Baez couldn't beat this rap, OJ no Hooray, I'm off the like Casey Anthony, hey ho Hey-ho! I sound like I'm trying to sing the fucking chorus to ""Hip Hop Hooray"", no I'm hollering you got bottom-end like an 8-0- 8 and I 'base' whether we're fucking off that instead of your face, so Let your low end raise, yo Tango, what you think, ho? Slow dancing or bowling? You trying to hold hands with your homie? What, you think I'm looking for romance 'cause I'm lonely? Change that tune, you ain't got a remote chance to control me Ho, I'm only vulnerable when I got a boner Superman try to fuck me over, it won't hurt Don't try to fix me, I'm broke so I don't work So are you, but you're broke cause you don't work But all bullshit aside, I hit a stride Still Shady inside, hair every bit as dyed As it used to be when I first introduced y'all to my skittish side And blamed it on him when they tried to criticize 'Cause we are the same, bitch",6143,en,

Sh-sh-sh-shady Aftermath, haha G-G-G-G-G-Unit!, haha. Cause we came here to set this party off right Let's bounce tonight And if they don't let us in through the front We'll come through the side Cuz i don't ever wanna leave the game without At least saying goodbye So all my people on the left, all my people on the right Swing one last time. Get your ass up for the doctor One more time, get your ass up for the doctor Come on now, here we go Cliff hanger, it's another club banger Got you hangin' on the edge of your seat Get on down. Times up, games over, you lose, I win 'bout to show these knuckleheads how to do this here Ooh yeah, new year, next phase, begin Look who's got you goin' crazy again I'm a trend, I set one every time I'm in I go out and just come back full circle again You a fad, that means your something that we already had But once you're gone, you don't come back, too bad. You're off the map now, radar can't even find you We stay on the grind, you slip, we out-grind you You walk around mad, you let your anger blind you We walk around just playin' the violin behind you Enough with all the pissin' and moanin', whinin' and bitchin' Sit and observe, listen, you'll learn if you pay attention Why ten multi-platinum albums later, three diamond World-wide, we're on the charts with a bullet and still climbin'. When dr. dre say crunk, you will get it crunk, get it crunk Crunk, crunk, crunk And when 50 cent says jump, you get on one foot and jump Jump, jump, jump, jump. The buzz is tremendous, we drop you all to sense it I don't gotta promote it for you to know that doc is off the benches. We keep the party rockin' off the henges We ain't showin' off, we just goin' off popular consensus. But critics say that Doc is soft, Doc is talk Doc is all washed up, knock it off Who the fuck is Doc impressin'? Doc is this, Doc is that, you got the wrong impression You must be on the cock of Doc, cuz Doc left you all guessin' So DJ take the needle and just drop it on the record (what) We gon' have this mutherfucker hoppin' in a second (bump bump) That's why we always save the best cut last To make you scratch and itch for it like fresh cut grass. Cuz we done swam with the sharks, wrestle with alligators Spoke to a generation of angry teenagers Whom if it wasn't for rap to bridge the gap Maybe raised to be racist Who may have never got to see our faces Grace the cover of Rolling Stone pages Broke down barriers of language and races Just call on the cape crusaders And leave it to me and Dre to pass the mic And we can play the back and forth all day Like the hot potato game, thats why we came to. 50 cent, come on!. Bounce now, hands up, you know how we do We make the club jump everywhere we go It's no secret, everybody know When Dre's involved, there's plenty money involved. And plenty honey's involved, the sunny Sunday's and palm trees Cali, everyday it's just another party from the valley's All the way to them 8 Mile alleys, let's rally. Hands up for the grand finale Now raise up out your seat, Dre is about to speak Blaze a pound of weed six days up out the week. You could catch me in the studio bangin' out the beats to Provide you with the heat that keep blazin' out your speaker. So never say never cuz Shady Aftermath together Along with G-Unit Records presents the return of the-the Doc (and Shady) No one could do it better We tear the club up and leave without a strand of evidence and uh. Yeah, haha Still Aftermath, 2006 And don't worry about that Detox album It's comin', we gonna make Dre do it, haha 50 cent, G-unit, Obie Trice, D-twizzy, Stat Quo, Dr. Dre We ain't leavin', let's go! haha Ladies and gentlemen, thank you all for comin' out, peace!

Fine Line,https://www.metrolyrics.com/fine-line-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Another day, another hotel, the inside of it is nice though Oh well, this is my life so as I go and try to close for the night's show To see how far that line goes, still blows my mind, show business Guess I'll just never get, so this shit just always feels so weird To this day because alls I ever did Was just say the shit I would've wanted to hear Other people say to me when I was a kid So please don't make me some type of hero Cause I will say some inspirational shit in a real way But still will have a field day with some of the fucked up shit In the world and tell it to suck on the dick, cause I still make fun Of a sitch someone's in like a son of a bitch at another's expense I'm fuckin' relentless it's fucked, when it comes to this pen I struggle with coming to senses, stuck on the fence With a balance beam. If I seem unbalanced, it's challenging But my conscience allows me to think the most foulish, childish things Without even blinking, without even thinkin' about All the stinkin' amounts of people that seems to be reachin' for the crowds They're screaming in The Palace, sold out this evening But now as I lay me down to sleeping Is it really my soul to keep, or have I sold it cheap? Is it greed? And do I take more than I need? When I joke of leavin', but keep overachievin' Cause what it's stole from me I've barely broken even. I know, it's a fine, fine line Living in a hole dying I know, it's a fine, fine line. Living in a hole dying. So a martyr is how I paint myself And through my harrowin' ordeals I'm so vain I want my respect But ignore the butterfly effect that comes from my dialect Till I sit in the dark and I reflect And my reflection shows what it's like here Cause this vanity, surrounded by all these lights Yeah, it's like a nightmare I said, this vanity surrounded by these lights is a nightmare And I don't like how I see myself, so I open the Bible to Isaiah Cause I swear to Christ there are nights when I stay up and might And say a prayer twice just to make sure God hears Cause this ice layer I skate on's a nice way of putting it, but I like stayin' Feistier than a triceratops and like a dice player I got a nice paradise here, sealed off in my lair Away from the bullshit good safe place to sit and talk shit It's funny, this house is quite big, but it ain't when you can't leave it And I feel so isolated, nice I made it But it's like I paid the price of fame twice, I hate it So I bitch about my life then make another song, vicious cycle ain't it?! Then wonder why I stay famous I keep walkin' the line This goldfish bowl gets old But especially when you don't know If your conscience is sayin' I told you so. Cause you don't even know anymore if you got the soul of a soldier Or you sold your soul. I know, it's a fine, fine line. Living in a hole dying I know, it's a fine, fine line Living in a hole dying. And from here you look so small Hovering high above us all Please come back To me. I still remember the times when They were simpler than the rhymes of Vanilla Ice were when I was just killin' the mics I'll never forget what that feeling was like I miss those times now when I was just starting out Without a dime and, now I'm diamond I can't even stage dive in the crowd anymore now when I've been Stuck in this house hibernatin' Hate even going outside It sucks, sometimes I just wanna walk into Target and look at shit and browse, I don't even want to buy nothin' I just wanna fuckin' walk around inside it Look how excited I sound when I get to talkin' bout life and Everything about it I miss, which now reminds me Put a thousand lighters in the sky for the Outsidaz Wow, I must have had Alzheimer's Long time since I shouted them out, 'bout time Cause it's been on my mind lately how Zee, you always supported me You vouched, I will never forget that and How you guys accepted me for me and Pace. I love you too, you slept on my couch And I've been thinkin' 'bout the time when I slept on the floor at The Outhouse Rhyming's all we ever wanted to do And regardless how life has turned out. Inside I'll, I'll always be an outsider. My life has been turned inside out but I I know, it's a fine, fine line Living in a hole dying I know, it's a fine, fine line Living in a hole dying But I keep walkin' the line...",4284,en,

[T.I.] Observing the estate through the gate from the outside looking in Bet you would think I got it made, better look again I got buttler, got a maid, and a mansion The belief is that I'm living out a millionaires fantasy With pantoms and ferrari's in the driveway But you see the pain and the change of the same man's Your vision jaded by the grammy's on the mantelpiece Just switch your camera lenses you would see the agony Apparantly it's damaging the man you see before you On the canvas he may seem alright but all the diasadvantages his family Encounters overpowers his extravagance Walk in my? I dare you While it really seem like the kings life aint glamourous As seen through the eyes of untrained amateurs Because the camera's don't see beyond the walls of the smiles Only counts until it falls in the pile.

But I been low key Hated on by most these niggaz wit' no cheese No deals and no G's No wheels and no keys, no boats no snowmobiles. And no ski's Mad at me 'cause I can finally afford to provide my family With groceries Got a crib wit' a studio and it's all full of tracks To add to the wall full of plaques. Hangin' up in the office in back of my house like trophies Did y'all think I'ma let my dough freeze? Ho, please You better bow down on both knees Who you think taught you to smoke trees? Who you think brought you the oldies?. Eazy-E's, Ice Cube's and D.O.C's The Snoop D-O-double-G's And the group that said, ""Mother, fuck tha police"" Gave you tape full of dope beats To bump when you stroll through in your hood.

I'm harder than me tryin' to park a Dodge When I'm drunk as fuck Right next to a humungous truck in a two-car garage Hoppin' out wit' two broken legs, tryin' to walk it off ""Fuck you too bitch, call the cops"". I'ma kill you and them loud ass motherfuckin' barkin' dogs And when the cops came through Me and Dre stood next to a burnt down house Wit' a can full of gas and a hand full of matches. And still weren't found out (Right here) From here on out it's the Chronic 2 Startin' today and tomorrow's the new And I'm still loco enough To choke you to death wit' a Charleston Chew. Slim shady, hotter than a set of twin babies In a Mercedes Benz wit the windows up When the temp goes up to the mid 80's Callin' men, ladies, sorry Doc but I been crazy There's no way that you can save me It's okay, go with him Hailie.

I ain't havin' that, this is the millenium of Aftermath It ain't gon' be nothin' after that So give me one more platinum plaque And fuck rap! You can have it back. So where's all the Madd Rappers at? It's like a jungle in this habitat But all you savage cats know that I was strapped wit' gats When you were cuddlin' a Cabbage Patch.

GOAT,https://www.metrolyrics.com/goat-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"""G.O.A.T."". I'm a goat and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and I consider myself one of those so thank you very much, here it goes!. This is the part I was worried about everyone thinks that my career is down the tubes and I'm in some dusty garage inhaling them carbon monoxide fumes and everyone's telling me what I should do and how I should come out and what to rap about and I know I got a lot up in my medulla oblongata that I gotta get out and I'm not sure how this is gonna come off they're probably gonna think that I'm coming off as cocky (haha) like I just started giving a fuck what you really think about me see, the thing about me is you don't really know a thing about me everyone's making a stink about me like there's some kind of a aura of that of the king around me surround me with nothin' but gangsters, killers, and bangers and the most dangerous criminals and I feel like I'm more comfortable around them than I do my own motherfuckin' neighbors but, see, my dream is to be remembered as one of the best when I leave but why does it seem like I'm not even put up in the same category as other emcees? so when Weezy says that he's better than Jay-z please, be that just subliminally means he thinks Jigga's the best and that he's the only one up in that league, see and it's easy just to consider me one of the greatest white rappers there is knowing god damn well that I'm one of the best motherfucking rappers who ever lived period.. I'm a goat and I don't mean to gloat but I know what I know and I know what you think and these magazines'll never put it in ink because how would it look if they considered me as a goat? and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and I consider myself one of those so thank you very much, here it goes!. Maybe they figure that I'm on my way out the game so they gotta go try to find em a new Eminem or a new Shady, if they think it's gonna happen man, I thought I was crazy or maybe I could be takin' it wrong and they're tryna pay homage to me in a strange way so let me pay homage to my fellow white competitors almost in the same way see, you hardly ever do hear anyone even bringing up that Paul Wall's white cause lyrically he doesn't pose a threat to anyone, see, he's just aight and Bubba Sparxxx, he just won't write because he's so caught up in that snow white that Timbaland can't even get him in the studio he's so gone off that coke, right and it's so sad, cause he's dope, right America's next great white hope, right so now they feel like they gotta come up with some corny ass white rapper show, right and which I'm still havin' mixed feelings about they said it'd be real, I'm just spillin' it out there's somethin' about a white boy talking black and runnin' around with a damn grill in his mouth and I love when the say that Tiger Woods shit ""Isn't it ironic that the best rapper's white and the best golfer's black?"" and I'm the one who's gotta catch all the flack offa' that but these are the people who never had heard of an Eminem until 8 Mile had came out but I had already hit middle America Parents had all got to likin' me now when suddenly I wasn't such a bad guy all of the hatred for me must've died thought I committed career suicide so I had to turn back into the bad guy so faggoty faggoty faggoty gays and anatomy God made Raggedy Ann and Andy not Raggedy Andy and Andy and Andy and Angelina Jolie is just another ho and Brad is a sucka' because once I fuck her she wants to go to Somalia to adopt another baby you know what I say? No You better save some of them kids from Madonna she needs all the publicity she can get you want a Shady? Well, you got it, man I ain't apologizin' for shit.. I'm a goat and I don't mean to gloat but I know what I know and I know what you think and these magazines'll never put it in ink because how would it look if they considered me as a goat? and for those of y'all who don't know what a goat is it means the greatest of all time and I consider myself one of those so thank you very much, here it goes!. Man, I'm takin' my ball and goin' home, man shit is too easy nobody even wants to pass me the ball cause (I'm a goat) so don't worry, I'm out the motherfuckin' game and y'all can sit and argue about who's the motherfuckin' best but y'all know that (I'm a goat) and like I said, I'm one of the motherfuckin' best before you get your panties in a motherfuckin' bunch but before I go, I'd like to say fuck you very much to everybody who wasn't there from the start and thank you very much to everybody who was and y'all ain't gotta say it, just think it cause I know that you know that I know that you know that I know that you know (I'm a goat) (hahahaha) I'm out, y'all it's been real, peace",4818,en,

I used to think I had bad luck, but I wasn't superstitious 'til one day I grew suspicious, when I stepped on a crack On Aunt Edna's stoop and got pooped on by a group of stupid pigeons Then we flew the coop to Michigan to start a new be-ditching Missouri from Michigan didn't work, so we moved Back to Missouri from Michigan, from Missouri back to Michigan Someone put me out my misery, I can't do this again Mom, please stick to a decision, discipline, last thing I wanna do Is listen she's like Lex Luthor, bitch, her rules are Krypton- -ite to the walls and I've lost my power to see through them bitches But I run into 'em, running through the kitchen Pretending to be blind Superman, cause I had no supervision But I did have a super power though, I could turn into invisible kid Disappear out of sight, like a true magician And one day Uncle Ronnie brought over this new, but different Music into the picture and it become my new religion. I remember it clearly, even today. Move back to Michigan again, to live with my Grandma nan Always itching for something to do, was flipping Through the radio stations one day and discovered This DJ who was mixing, I say it to this day, if you ain't listened To the wizard, you ain't have a fucking clue what you was missing I'd zone out with my headphones, all I remember doing's wishing for shoes Fuck them stupid Pumas bitch, it's all about them new edition Troops You get them LL Cool J cooling system Think I finally maneuvered to 8 Mile and Hoover And somehow I saw my future is in this, that's how I know my mission Little boom box booming, spitting, practicing numerous rhythms When I sit in my room envisioning my dreams come to fruition I remember Proof would visit, couldn't wait to play him my new shit He'd go complete ballistic, go through the roof for his shit It's like we knew the instant, we touched a mic that both of us Too existed to do this shit, never quit, too persistent. We are the underground empire.

And the next thing I know something came crawling up from below Something that made Godzilla look like a plane. And I don't quit, won't change, it's like a Groundhog's Day So crowd around y'all, cause you may, so you can't pop your head.

Guts Over Fear,https://www.metrolyrics.com/guts-over-fear-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Feels like a close, it's coming to Fuck am I gonna do? It's too late to start over This is the only thing I, thing I know. Sometimes I feel like all I ever do is Find different ways to word the same, old song Ever since I came along From the day the song called ''Hi! My Name Is"" dropped Started thinking my name was fault Cause anytime things went wrong I was the one who they would blame it on The media made me the, uh, equivalent of a modern-day Genghis Khan Tried to argue it was only entertainment, dawg Gangsta? Naw, courageous balls Had to change my style, they said I'm way too soft And I sound like AZ and Nas, out came the claws And the fangs been out since then But up until the instant that I've went against it It was ingrained in me that I wouldn't amount to a shitstain I thought No wonder I had to unlearn everything my brain was taught Do I really belong in this game? I pondered I just wanna play my part, should I make waves or not? So back and forth in my brain the tug of war wages on And I don't wanna seem ungrateful or disrespect the artform I was raised upon But sometimes you gotta take a loss And have people rub it in your face before you get made pissed off And keep pluggin', it's your only outlet And your only outfit so you know they gonna talk about it Better find a way to counter it quick and make it, ah Feel like I've already said this a kabillion eighty times How many times can I say the same thing different ways that rhyme? What I really wanna say is, if there's anyone else that can relate to my story Bet you feel the same way I felt when I was in the same place you are When I was afraid to.... I was a... Afraid to make a single sound Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out Afraid I'd never be found I didn't wanna go another round An angry man's power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear, the time is here Guts over fear, I shall not tear For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear. Feels like a close, it's coming to Fuck am I gonna do? It's too late to start over This is the only thing I, thing I know. It's like I was there once, single parents Hate your appearance, did you struggle to find your place in this world? And the pain spawns all the anger on But it wasn't until I put the pain in songs learned who to aim it on That I made a spark, started to spit hard as shit Learned how to harness it while the reins were off And there was a lot of bizarre shit, but the crazy part Was soon as I stopped saying ""I gave a fuck"" Haters started to appreciate my art And it just breaks my heart to look at all the pain I've caused But what am I gonna do when the rage is gone? And the lights go out in that trailer park? And the window is closing and there's nowhere else that I can go with flows And I'm frozen cause there's no more emotion for me to pull from Just a bunch of playful songs that I made for fun So to the break of dawn here I go recycling the same, old song But I'd rather make ""Not Afraid 2"" than make another mothafuckin' ""We Made You"" uh Now I don't wanna seem indulgent when I discuss my lows and my highs My demise and my uprise, pray to God I just opened enough eyes later on And gave you the supplies and the tools to hopefully use it to make you strong Enough to lift yourself up when you feel like I felt Cause I can't explain to y'all how dang exhausted my legs felt Just having to balance my dang self But on eggshells I was made to walk But thank you, ma, 'cause that gave me the Strength to cause Shady-mania, so many empty that stadium At least I made it out of that house and a found a place in this world when the day was done So this is for every kid who all's they ever did was dreamt of one day just getting accepted I represent him or her, anyone similar, you are the reason that I made this song And everything you're scared to say don't be afraid to say no more From this day forward, just let them a-holes talk Take it with a grain of salt and eat their fucking faces off The legend of the angry blonde lives on through you when I'm gone And to think I was... gone. I was a... Afraid to make a single sound Afraid I would never find a way out, out, out Afraid I'd never be found I didn't wanna go another round An angry man's power will shut you up Trip wires fill this house with tip-toe love Run out of excuses with every word So here I am and I will not run Guts over fear, the time is here Guts over fear, I shall not tear For all the times I let you push me around And let you keep me down Now I got, guts over fear, guts over fear",4704,en,

Sometimes I think I'm crazy, I'm crazy, oh, so crazy Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time? But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no. 'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leaning on me 'Cuz sometimes it feels like the world's almost over But then she comes back to me. My baby girl keeps getting' older I watch her grow up with pride People make jokes 'cuz they don't understand me They just don't see my real side.

But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted So here's what I'm facin', 3 felonies, 6 years of probation I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman. Man, I should have seen it coming, what I stick my penis up in? Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'? But fuck it, it is over, there's no more reason to cry no more I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore, Hailie.

Somedays I sit staring out the window Watchin' this world pass me by Sometimes I think there's nothin' to live for I almost break down and cry Sometimes I think I'm crazy I'm crazy, oh, so crazy Why am I here? Am I just wasting my time? But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no. Sometimes it feels like the world's on my shoulders Everyone's leaning on me 'Cause sometimes it feels like the world's almost over But then she comes back to me. My baby girl keeps gettin' older I watch her grow up with pride People make jokes 'cause they don't understand me They just don't see my real side I act like shit don't faze me, inside it drives me crazy My insecurities could eat me alive But then I see my baby, suddenly I'm not crazy It all makes sense when I look into her eyes, oh, no.

Man, if I could sing, I'd keep singin' this song to my daughter If I could hit the notes, I'd blow something as long as my father To show her how I feel about her, how proud I am that I got her God, I'm a daddy, I'm so glad that her mom didn't (want her) Now you probably get this picture from my public persona That I'm a pistol packin' drug addict, who bags on his mama But I wanna to just take this time out to be perfectly honest 'Cause there's a lot of shit I keep bottled, that hurts deep inside Of my soul and just know that I grow colder the older I grow This boulder on my shoulder gets heavy and harder to hold And this load is like the weight of the world And I think my neck is breakin' Should I just give up or try to live up to these expectations? Now look, I love my daughter more than life in itself But I got a wife that's determined to make my life livin' hell But I handle it well, given the circumstances I'm dealt So many chances, man, it's too bad, could have had someone else But the years that I've wasted is nothing to the tears that I've tasted So here's what I'm facin', three felonies, six years of probation I've went to jail for this woman, I've been to bat for this woman I've taken bats to people's backs, bent over backwards for this woman Man, I should have seen it coming, what I stick my penis up in? Wouldn't have ripped the pre-nup up if I'da seen what she was fuckin'? But fuck it, it is over, there's no more reason to cry no more I got my baby, baby, the only lady that I adore, Hailie So sayonara, try tommorra, nice to know ya Our baby's traveled back to the arms of her rightful owner And suddenly it seems like my shoulder blades have just shifted It's like the greatest gift you can get, the weight has been lifted.

Headlights,https://www.metrolyrics.com/headlights-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Mom, I know I let you down And though you say the days are happy Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up? And mom, I know he's not around But don't you place the blame on me As you pour yourself another drink I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far. I went in headfirst Never thinking about who what I said hurt, in what verse My mom probably got it the worst The brunt of it, but as stubborn as we are Did I take it too far? Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs But regardless I don't hate you cause ma! You're still beautiful to me, cause you're my mom Though far be it for you to be calling, my house was Vietnam Desert Storm and both of us put together can form an atomic bomb Equivalent to Chemical warfare And forever we can drag this on and on But, agree to disagree That gift from me up under the Christmas tree don't mean shit to me You're kicking me out? It's 15 degrees and it's Christmas Eve (little prick just leave) ma, let me grab my fucking coat Anything to have each other's goats, why we always at each others throats? Especially when dad, he fucked us both We're in the same fucking boat You'd think that it'd make us close (nope) Further away that drove us, but together headlights shine A car full of belongings Still got a ways to go Back to grandma's house it's straight up the road And I was the man of the house, the oldest So my shoulders carried the weight of the load Then Nate got taken away by the state at 8 years old, and That's when I realized you were sick and it wasn't fixable or changable And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though, but. I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far. Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though Cause you ain't even get to witness your grand baby's growth But I'm sorry mama for Cleaning Out My Closet, at the time I was angry Rightfully maybe so, never meant that far to take it though, cause Now I know it's not your fault, and I'm not making jokes That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time it's on the radio And I think of Nathan being placed in a home And all the medicine you fed us And how I just wanted you to taste your own, but Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow And I'm way too old to cry, that shit's painful though But ma, I forgive you, so does Nathan yo All you did, all you said, you did your best to raise us both Foster care, that cross you bare, few may be as heavy as yours But I love you Debbie Mathers, oh what a tangled web we have, cause One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address But I'd have flipped every mattress, every rock and desert cactus Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas Someone ever moved them from me? That you could bet your ass's If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa, kidnap them And although one has only met their grandma Once you pulled up in our drive one night As we were leaving to get some hamburgers Me, her and Nate, we introduced you, hugged you And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me As we pulled off to go our separate paths, and I saw your headlights as I looked back And I'm mad I didn't get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad So Mom, please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet I guess I had to get this off my chest I hope I get the chance to lay it fore I'm dead The stewardess said to fasten my seatbelt, I guess we're crashing So if I'm not dreaming, I hope you get this message That I'll always love you from afar, cause you're my mama.... I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far. I want a new life, (start over) one without a cause (clean slate) So I'm coming home tonight, well, no matter what the cost And if the plane goes down, or if the crew can't wake me up Well, just know that I'm alright, I was not afraid to die Oh, even if there's songs to sing, well my children will carry me Just know that I'm alright, I was not afraid to die Because I put my faith in my little girls, so I never say goodbye cruel world Just know that I'm alright, I am not afraid to die.

(up and down) (so then what happened?) So he put the mic down and picked a guitar up. (picked a guitar up) (and then he what?) Started singin the blues like there was no tomorrow. (no tomorrow) (come on) Left his boys in the House of Pain. (in the House of Pain) (biach) It was the wisest decision he ever made. (ever made) But the dumbest thing that he could ever do.

(long ago) Kid Rock and Limp Bizkit came along now Don't nobody wanna hear your old ass sing no more. (Yo yo yo yo yo yo). Remember back in '94, Like right before Miss Everlast was Whitey Ford, Before his heart attack had him on life support. (beep beep) When House of Pain was out of fame, Like someone doused the flame, And they became destined to never jump around again. Or even further back, when I first had heard the knack, When you were down with syndicate. I went to get the shit, man I was into it. But then you went, and took your style, and switched the shit. Now you sound ridiculous. You dickless piece of shit, how could you diss me bitch? (huh?) I liked you, thought you was alright for a white dude. Remember Sway and Tech when I came up and sat beside you, Started rhymin' then you left the room and didn't say goodbye or nuthin. Like you mad that someone else was white and tryin' ta rhyme or somethin'. I'm sorry man, I wasn't tryin ta steal your light or nuthin. But you're a homosexual, white rappin' Irish (unknown) Man I wish I was Irish, I could be a (unknown) too. Then I'd be confused as you, and I wouldn't know what to do. What's up witchu? I never fucked witchu, why would you fuck with me? Knowin' I could rap circles around you, what? Is you nuts as me? Plus I can sing better than you, and I don't fuckin' sing. And probably play guitar better, and I aint never touched a string. But I ain't mad at you, I'd hate me too if I was you. I'm what you used to be; shit, you was me in '92. So every time I write a lyric, I'ma think of you. And maybe that'll help me know what it's like to sing the blues. (la-di-da). Cuz I remember all those years. How it was when you were here.

All this commotion emotions run deep as oceans explodin' Tempers flarin' from parents just blow 'em off and keep goin' Not takin' nothin' from no one give 'em hell long as I'm breathin' Keep kickin' ass in the mornin' and takin' names in the evenin'.

I was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months My faggot father must have had his panties up in a bunch 'Cause, he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye?

What I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb But the smartest shit I did was take the bullets outta that gun 'Cause, I'da killed him; shit I woulda shot Kim and him, both It's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to 'The Eminem Show'. I'm sorry momma I never meant to hurt you I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time. I said, I'm sorry momma I never meant to hurt you I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet. Now, I would never diss my own momma just to get recognition Take a second to listen for who you think this record is dissin' But put yourself in my position, just try to envision Witnessin' your momma poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen. Bitchin' that someone's always goin' throuh her purse and shit's missin' Goin' through public housin' systems, victim of Munchausen's Syndrome My whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't Till I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to ya stomach. Doesn't it? Wasn't it the reason you made that CD for me Ma? So you could try to justify the way you treated me Ma? But guess what? You're gettin' older now and it's cold when your lonely And Nathan's growin' up so quick he's gonna know that you're phony. And Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful But you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral See what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong Bitch do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom. But how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get You selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit Remember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? Well guess what, I am dead, dead to you as can be. I'm sorry momma I never meant to hurt you I never meant to make you cry, but tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet, one more time.

Shit, talk about your brain being baked My shit's still in the oven on 480 Degrees Hailey Jade Daddy loves you baby Don't ever tell me how to raise my daughter Fuck you lady! You critics wanna criticize but couldnt visualize Individuals lives through a criminal's eyes(fuck it!) The neighborhood that I grew up in You could die for nothing And Dirty Dozen watches over me So try some dumb shit I'll have a fucking man raped with a band-aid over his mouth and shove his head in the fan blade Don't ever tell me what I can and what I can't say Or change cause of the Age range in my fan base Like I give a fuck who's buying this shit Quit fucking buying it I'm tired bitch I'm dying to quit Hip Hop is universal now It's all commercial now It's like a circle full of circus clowns up in the circuit now But now the white kids like it So they tell me I can buy it But as soon as I get on the mic it's like the night get silent Either that or booed, thats why I keep an attitude. And go to sleep with it and wake up with it every afternoon. I'm sick of being judged, fuck it let me see a judge I'll confess to every murder I committed since 3 years old (Dr. Dre) Yo Fuck that Turn that shit off Let's get the fuck out of here You know how we do (echo)",3917,en,

Verse 1: I come home every single day from working double shifts And stop along the way to pick you up a couple gifts I come inside and you pretend you miss me when you kiss me Then you diss me and we strenuously fight continuously Again you frisk me, for numbers trying to bust me It must be only just because you never learned to trust me Plus we only squabble only irrelevant issues Too many tissues, for my feelings you misuse I buy you jewelry, you make a fool of me I bring you diamond rings you say I'm bad at timing things So what's a man to do when all i hand to you is handed back to me You act to be this gangsta bitch, that ain't what first attracted me I used to love your company now you always bugging me For information and you tell your friends you plan on dumping me So I'ma wait for your evacuation Cause every accusation makes me wanna smack your face in See I've never been so sure, and your just insecure So my solution to your jealousy presents a cure I recommend you take your things and check them in Look at the nervous wreck I'm in, I need my second wind, Say What?. Chorus: Men Singing Jealous, Jealousy, Jealousy (8X). Women's Voice: (Talking over singing) Fuck you and what you going through Fuck Eminem, he just mad cause I left that nigga for another man Me and Eminem don't need nothing but my and his money Immature, Me? Nigga ain't got no dick, no swang in his thang Know what I'm saying? He just mad cause I'm getting it all night Jealous of me, know what I'm saying? That's what I'm talking about Mother fucker just trying to get his pussy. Verse 2: I used to be a puppet and a sucker for your silent treatments I used to be intoxicated with your sweet sense Until the day I started following your feetprints And tapping in your phone conversations through the heat vents It made complete sense, there's someone else you like So I confronted you and asked you who was Mike? And you was like, **I need a new nigga** (sampled) Someone rich that I could follow And you'll be over me by the time you see tomorrow Leaving me in sorrow, Brandy never felt so broken hearted I fell apart when you departed then the joking started I was an open target, you play comedian And I became the laughing stock. but now I'm on my feet again And so we meet again, your acting like an ex-wife All in my sex life, I got a message from Phife He goes, ""You didn't want me to see you then, I don't want you now"" Take a towel, wipe your brow, quit trying to hunt me down You run me down and now your trying to apologize For all the lies and every time you made me ball my eyes Because I got a bigger wallet size, you wanna swing it Jealousy is in the house ya'll, Fellas sing it....

Kick Off,https://www.metrolyrics.com/kick-off-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"[Intro: Eminem & Royce Da 5'9""] I've always looked at battle rap as competition or war, and the main objective is to destroy, completely fucking obliterate your opponent by saying anything and everything, whatever the fuck you can, to get a reaction from the crowd. So nothing's off limits I need you to spit that lyrical miracle... in the swimming pool. [Verse 1] Before this kicks off, let me set my balls in this tees 'Cause I'm dottin' i's every time I cross one of these There's not a redeeming quality at all in me It's impossible, seems like an implausible dream Positive clean thoughts intervene But they're all either altered and mean Assault and demean, tossed and they're being lost in the scheme Squashed in-between a brainwashing machine Like an Islamic regime, a jihadist extreme radical Suicide bomber that's seeing Ariana Grande sing her last song of the evening And as the audience from the damn concert is leaving Detonates the device strapped to his abdominal region I'm not gonna finish that, for obvious reasons But bring your dogs, I'ma muzzle 'em I'm not Middle Eastern but I'll make a bitch Raqqa hijab And at least a extra large in the T-shirt Headscarf and a piece of tarp underneath the carpet, hasta la vista I go Hamas on the beats to a paradox on the beach And a pair of crotchless underwear on a terrorist watch list Gettin' head in the sand like an embarrassed ostrich Professional shit sprayer Bitch watch who you talkin' to, like Apple wristwear Endangered species in this ABC shit a bit scarce Prey's decreasing, I face extinction like disc players Told this chick she's hot as Jada Pinkett And just stared 'til I made her think it Said, ""Maybe we should just get married."" She's facing me, I placed my feet with my hips square Tell her, ""Turn around,"" spread her legs for me, then I hit bare Leave her stretched out like a baby T-shirt on Ric Flair As I ripped her, anal beads in a split rear Spray Febreze in the chick's hair Make her wheeze tryna get air I played for keeps, there's no escaping me, I have a bitch scared And chained to me, and throw away the key And she'll be so afraid to leave That even if she ends up breaking free she'll just sit there Tryin' to scrape up enough courage and strength to get up It's impossible like rapin' a slut We stay butt-naked and fuck You're close, wait for you, what? My idea, you comin' too, it's waking you up With smelling salts after I Quaalude your cup That'll straighten you up if you try to stray like a pup Hate to get bogged down in details But bitch, I'm like the dog pound with females My brain is corrupt, real life, Hillside Strangler I strangle a skank's neck 'til it's triangular Shape but it's upside down, and my mouth ain't gonna shut And mention me in your raps if it makes you a buck Or helps you rake in the duckets, I want payment in pub 'Cause I ain't tryna get in your bars like I'm waiting the club But if you put me in your lines, I'm takin' a cut. [Verse 2] Get a million writers inside of a room combined in it Try to get every idea of every possible line to spit Every punchline, every combination that rhymes with it Bitch, a whole team can't see me, there's no i's in it Head so big, I shot myself ten times in it Tryna commit suicide in it, took five minutes And I survived this shit Someone's gonna challenge me, who? Battle me and win, that's a fucking fallacy too You name one motherfucker in this galaxy, *spits*, reality You fantasy, rally your troops, try to boost the morale Only time I start a movement's a bowel I can't even give a ""yeah"" or a ""woo"" when you rap in the booth Not even a ""nah"" or a ""boo"" 'Cause even though I'm allergic to the crap that you spew When I'm 'bout to break out, I don't mean get a rash from it too 'Cause when I say I have allergies, I actually do But that's just an analogy, I've never had a reaction to you. [Verse 3] Creature from the Black Lagoon I reach up and I smack the moon You're grief struck that I'm back so soon Your teacher for this afternoon Creep up with a pack of hoodlums We pack a punch like Capri Sun Heat tucked like we each snuck in a submachine gun We stuck in a submarine bun, with a bag of shrooms Cup of lean up in the padded room Justin Bieber in a Catholic school Selling dust and reefer when your back is to him Don't adjust your speaker I'll cuss the stripes off of a fuckin' zebra when I'm at the zoo Huffin' cleaner 'til I gag from fumes Fuck Christina with a plastic spoon While I bump some G-Funk and blast some Snoop 'Cause her double g-cups are massive, huge! It's fun for me just to grab a boob Plus my penis got an attitude My fuckin' Weiner's in a combative mood Come and suck a mean one like it's mad at you I speak tongue and cheek, what you asslicks do 'Cause you love to eat butt, it's sad but true. [Verse 4] I just sprung a leak suddenly What I think in my gut instinct become in sync My thoughts and my stomach link up with each other Ink touches the pad, then boom! Since the day Dre gave me beats, I was made elite That's basically what makes me me Creating stink, 'til these tats are fading ink Who's the greatest? Think we're still debating, wink ADD, and better put out an APB 'Cause it'll take LAPD and me layin' in the street For you to see Shady beat And I'll bet ya they'd need cleats 'Cause I'd have to be stomped by forty men to suffer a defeat I pray please Jesus to make me decent Inhaling the main ingredient of pain relievers, and saline I take three Aleves, tryna break these fevers, I'm ailing I stay free of divas and ladies screamin' 'Cause they keep schemin' on me Vading keepin' the women at bay Like Laci Peterson, baby fetuses Legs and feet have been weighted, chained in semen It's straight demonâand wait! Even if it takes meat cleavers to make believers Mistake-free schemes are enablin' me to remain deviant Breakbeat, eat her like steak meat Emcees take seats like AMC theaters Deranged ringleader, depraved king Who mainstream media hates Which makes things easier, still under scrutiny Villainous smooth criminal, livin' room With the nude Reese Witherspoon Who was bruised, beat with a broom It's in two pieces, and lays deceased in it Bit with a chewed leash, and his chain-link leapin' it Live in the booth, shave, eat, bathe, drink, sleep in it R-A-P bleed the shit, still and I poop, pee it It's a spillage, a sewage leak, waste deep feces The syllables ooze fecal, they feel like renewed leases 'Cause my brain releases 'em. [Verse 5] Like waste excretion, it's simultaneously As I'm givin' these fools grief, they're feelin' the blues 'Cause even if stealin' my shoes, thieves Just to fill 'em's a huge feat A hill and it's too steep Obey these demons, we're still in cahoots Keep feedin' me blank sheets As soon as I sink these teeth And I'm killin' the loose leaf Time to shake these trees again Wait, make that phrase repeat again Killin' the loose leaf, shake these trees again Get the rake, but it ain't me leavin' 'em. [Verse 6] Vicodins, new prints, I bite them and chew them The whites and the blues mixed with nitrus balloons And I like to sniff gluesticks, put Ricin on toothpicks On the mic I'm just ruthless, a crisis, a nuisance Who I influence I give two shits If they wanna license my music to entice with Then use the shit like it's the blueprint for ISIS recruitment. [Verse 7] Excuse me while I stare into space for a few In a daze or haze, glazed over, crazed warp loon Mental cased off, always had a straight-forward view But you bozos keep givin' the flamethrower fuel No one's ever sank lower, shrewd, and way more rude Beast-mode like a lawn-mower blade rolled thru it And this has little to do with bein' gay, boy It's just where the wordplay's goin' But ain't much I can say or do 'Cause ain't no excuse, the way I go at you {censored} You say I'm always screw-faced So if I look your way, you're screwed 'Cause if looks could kill, I could start a hate-war too 'Cause I'd murder you straight bitches by turnin' the gaze on you. [Verse 8] Let's take it back before the tightly-worn pants To the Nike, Jordan, hats The stripe Lee's, Jordache, and the white tees Lightning storms might be formed fast Such a frightening forecast! But when you're slightly hoarse, rasp From the cyphering or-gasp, but still reciting your raps While you're tightening your grasp around the mic 'cause you done shitted on it so much, you're always reminded of your past 'Cause your heiny's sore, that's 'Cause you still haven't finished fuckin' wiping your ass From the night before last No good, but rap somethin' I'm too-good-for-my-own-good at Fuck adulthood, I'm a grown-up brat Where your cojones at? Mine are always being rode, in fact: They're frozen, you ever seen a cul-de-sac? So big they fell out my scrotum, I just sowed 'em back. [Verse 9] Dick so long, need a shoulder-strap For that, gotta unroll it and fold it back So difficult to wrap in the pro-filactic, it overlaps it So I pack a Trojan so fat, when I lay it flat it's like a yoga mat Make a bitch think she's in aerobics class The bear you don't wanna poke its back The backbone of rap, your fuckin' lead singles are my bonus tracks When I appear, my peers stop Hearts fall in their stomach, their spirits drop Careers flop, their gears lock, severe shock Fear at the mere thought Lyrics are top-tier, I'm so high at the top I'm in the sky when I talk Bitch, I'm so fly when I walk, my ears pop. [Outro] Oh, and I'm just playin' ladies, you know I love you I got a idea for a line",9492,en,
Kids,https://www.metrolyrics.com/kids-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"[Mr. Mackey] (Eric Cartman) And everyone should get along. Okay children quiet down, quiet down Children I'd like to introduce our new substitute teacher for the day His name is Mr. Shady Children quiet down please Brian don't throw that (SHUT UP!) Mr. Shady will be your new substitute while Mr. Kaniff is out with pneumonia (HE'S GOT AIDS!) Good luck Mr. Shady. [Eminem] Hi there little boys and girls (FUCK YOU!) Today we're gonna to learn how to poison squirrels But first, I'd like you to meet my friend Bob (Huh?) Say hi Bob! (""Hi Bob"") Bob's 30 and still lives with his mom and he don't got a job, cause Bob sits at home and smokes pot but his twelve-year old brother looks up to him an awful lot And Bob likes to hang out at the local waffle spot and wait in the parkin lot for waitresses off the clock when it's late and the lot gets dark and fake like he walks his dog Drag 'em in the woods and go straight to the chopping blocks (AHH!) And even if they escaped and they got the cops the ladies would all be so afraid, they would drop the charge 'til one night Mrs. Stacey went off the job when she felt someone grab her whole face and said not to talk But Stacey knew it was Bob and said knock it off But Bob wouldn't knock it off cause he's crazy and off his rocker Crazier than Slim Shady is off the vodka You couldn't even take him to Dre's to get Bob a ""Dr."" He grabbed Stace' by the legs as chopped it off her and dropped her off in the lake for the cops to find her But ever since the day Stacey went off to wander they never found her, and Bob still hangs at the waffle diner And that's the story of Bob and his marijuana, and what it might do to you So see if the squirrels want any - it's bad for you. [Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]. See children, drugs are bahhhd (c'mon) and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (ask him man) and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (that's right) She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will) So kids say no to drugs (that's right) So you don't act like everyone else does (uh-huh) Then there's really nothin else to say (sing along) Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?. [Eminem] My penis is the size of a peanut, have you seen it? FUCK NO you ain't seen it, it's the size of a peanut (Huh?) Speakin of peanuts, you know what else is bad for squirrels? Ecstasy is the worst drug in the world If someone ever offers it to you, don't do it Kids two hits'll probably drain all your spinal fluid and spinal fluid is vital, you won't get it back So don't get attached, it'll attack every bone in your back Meet Zach, twenty-one years old After hangin out with some friends at a frat party, he gets bold and decides to try five, when he's bribed by five guys and peer pressure will win every time you try to fight it Suddenly, he starts to convulse and his pulse goes into hyperdrive and his eyes roll back in his skull {*blblblblblb*} His back starts tah - look like the McDonald's Arches He's on Donald's carpet, layin horizontal barfin {*BLEH*} And everyone in the apartment starts laughin at him ""Hey Adam, Zach is a jackass, look at him!"" cause they took it too, so they think it's funny So they're laughing at basically nothing except maybe wasting his money Meanwhile, Zach's in a coma, the action is over and his back and his shoulders hunched up like he's practicin yoga And that's the story of Zach, the ecstasy maniac So don't even feed that to squirrels class, cause it's bad for you. [Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]. See children, drugs are bahhhd (that's right) and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (that's right) and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can) She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (she will) So kids say no to drugs (smoke crack) So you don't act like everyone else does (that's right) And there's really nothin else to say (but umm) Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?. [Eminem] And last but not least, one of the most humungous problems among young people today, is fungus It grows from cow manure, they pick it out, wipe it off, bag it up, and you put it right in your mouth and chew it Yum yum! Then you start to see some dumb stuff And everything slows down when you eat some of 'em. And sometimes you see things that aren't there (Like what?) Like fat woman in G-strings with orange hair (Mr. Shady what's a G-string?) It's yarn Claire Women stick 'em up their behinds, go out and wear 'em (Huh?) And if you swallow too much of the magic mushrooms Whoops, did I say magic mushrooms? I meant fungus Ya tongue gets, all swoll up like a cow's tongue (How come?) cause it comes from a cow's dung (Gross!) See drugs are bad, it's a common fact But your mom and dad, know that's all that I'm good at (Oh!) But don't be me, cause if you grow up and you go and O.D. They're gonna come for me and I'ma have to grow a goatee and get a disguise and hide, cause it'll be my fault So don't do drugs, and do exactly as I don't, cause I'm bad for you. [Chorus: Mr. Mackey (Eminem)]. See children, drugs are bahhhd (uh-huh) and if you don't believe me, ask ya dahhhd (put that down) and if you don't believe him, ask ya mom (you can ask) She'll tell you how she does 'em all the time (and she will) So kids say no to drugs (say no) So you don't act like everyone else does (like I do) And there's really nothin else to say (that's right) Drugs are just bad, mmm'kay?. [Mr. Mackey] (Eric Cartman) Come on children, clap along (SHUT UP!) Sing along children (Suck my motherfuckin dick!) Drugs are just bad, drugs are just bad (South Park is gonna sue me!) So don't do drugs (Suck my motherfuckin penis!) so there'll be more for me (Hippie! God damnit!) (Mushrooms killed Kenny! *fart* Ewww, ahhh!) (So, fucked up, right now.)",5710,en,

Kings Never Die,https://www.metrolyrics.com/kings-never-die-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Here to stay Even when I'm gone When I close my eyes Through the passage of time Kings never die. I can hear the drummer drumming And the trumpets, someone's tryna summon someone, I know somethin's coming But I'm runnin' from it to be standing at the summit And plummet, how come it wasn't what I thought it was Was it, too good to be true? Have nothin', get it all but too much of it Then lose it again, did I swallow hallucinogens Cause if not, where the hell did it go? Cause here I sit in Lucifer's den by the dutch oven Just choosing to sin Even if it means I'm sellin' my soul, just to be the undisputed again Do whatever I gotta do just to win Cause I got this motherfuckin' cloud over my head. Crown around it, thorns on it Cracks in it, bet you morons didn't think I'd be back, did ya?. How 'bout that, I'm somehow now back to the underdog But no matter how loud that I bark, this sport is somethin' I never bow-out at. I complain about the game, I shout and I pout, it's a love-hate But I found out that I can move a mountain of doubt. Even when you bitches are countin' me out, and I appear to be down for the count Only time I ever been out and about. Is drivin' around town with my fuckin' whereabouts in a doubt Cause I been lost tryna think of what I did to get here but I'm not a quitter. Gotta get up, give it all I got or give up. Spit on, shit on, stepped on, but kept goin' I'm tryna be headstrong but it feels like I slept on my neck wrong. Cause you're moving onto the next, but is the respect gone? Cause someone told me that. (Kings never die). Don't give me that sob story liar, don't preach to the choir. You ain't never even had to reach in the fire to dig deep. Nobody ever handed me shit in life, not even a flyer Wouldn't even take shit into consideration Obliterate anyone in the way. I think I see why a lot of rappers get on these features and try to show out on a track with me. But it'd actually have to be a fuckin' blow-out to get me to re-tire Tell these new artists that kings never die. Did it just say I've been upstaged? Why am I online? It's driving me crazy I'm ridin' shotgun tryna get a gauge On what's hot, but I'm not one to conform. But as days pass in this shit And opinions sway, I can hear 'em say If I stay passionate maybe I can stage a miraculous Comeback as if I went away But detractors just say so much for the Renegade. Someone's gonna make me blow my composure Here I go again, center stage and I feel like I'm in a cage They so want a champion to fall It's no wonder why I laugh at 'em, cause why can't we win 'em all? So fuck what these cynics say. (It) just goes ta show that when my back's against the wall And I'm under a tack again, that I'll act as if I'm 'posed ta With this pent up rage, cause all these plaques in my office On the floor stacked against the door. Are they just metaphors for the odds of me comin' back again?. Cause all the accomplishments, accolades, awards And trophies just don't mean jack anymore If I'm here today and gone tomorrow And I'm not gonna be. Here to stay. Even when I'm gone When I close my eyes. Through the passage of time Kings never die. I want it, I'm comin' to get it So you son of a bitches don't duck you're gonna get Riddick Bowe'd Critics'll end up in critical, think your shit is dope all you're gonna get is smoked And I'm not stopping 'til I'm on top again, all alone and on a throne. Like a token of respect, or a homage poem, or an ode I've been owed Tossed in the air by my own arm, and launched so hard it broke my collarbone And when it's my time to go, I'm still not leaving Stop for no one, I don't know but I've been told an obstacle that Blocks your road, knock it over, time to go for that pot of gold, cause. They say kings never die Just ask Jam Master Jay They just grow wings and they fly So, hands up, reach for the sky Try to hold and prolong these moments Cause in a blink of an eye They'll be over. Tryna secure your legacy like Shakur And ensure nobody's ever gonna be what you were So before you're leavin' this Earth You want people to feel the fury of a pure evil cerebral berserk Deacon of words, syllable genius at work Plus I'm thinkin' that they're mistakin' my kindness for weakness, kill 'em with meanness I went from powdered milk and Farina To flippin' burgers on the grill for some peanuts From Gilbert's to arenas, call me Gilbert Arenas, still appeal to the dreamers I made it to the silverscreen but Rocky's still what the theme is Khalil on the beat cause makin' the beat ain't the same feelin' to me as killin' the beat is Or fulfillin' to me is what fillin' a seat is It's that ""Sound Bombing"" Thirstin' Howl Common, underground, Diamond D, Outsidaz Stomach growl, throbbin' hunger, out-rhymin' everyone God just give me one shot, I swear that I won't let you down I'ma be around forever-and-a-day, even in the ground You ain't never ever gonna hear 'em say I ain't.

If I was frozen inside of a moment If I could capture time inside a capsule An hourglass full of sand in the palm of my hand, it passes through it If I can grasp it, and just control what happens to it Then I can trap it, so no more time elapses through it If raps could do it, maybe I could tap into it Then I could try to channel it through Cadillacs and Buicks To transmit through 'em, to make you put your ass into it And that's when you hit the roof because you can't sit through it Your passions too much for you to not be dancing to it And as you do it, your movements become fast and fluent You're mashin' to it, moshing until you're black and bluish You're acting foolish, this music it has influenced you to be rowdy but in an orderly fashion True it's chaotic, but it's got your body moving as a unit Uniting together tonight, so make it last and you better just. Lose yourself in this music This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (Go) You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better) Lose yourself in this music This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (Go) You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better). Cause when we descend together, we begin to move as one In perfect unison just like the moon and sun Illuminate the room and humans soon become aluminum Rhythmically in sync, if you'll excuse the pun But if you could lose it once, I mean if you could let shit go Relax, take a breath, and just let it exit slow To rest your soul, you could leave the rest to me If I could give the world a hit of ecstasy To make 'em feel the feeling that I'm feeling right this minute Cause I feel like the night won't end til I get finished So close the shades, makin' sure no light gets in it The sky's the limit tonight because the night's infinite A high percentage of black people and white mixed in it But no one really gives a fuck cause they just like what's spinnin' His life was spinnin', the whole entire night just spinnin' Like life's beginning, so come out from inside your skin and quit hidin' in it. Lose yourself in this music This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (Go) You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better) Lose yourself in this music This moment we own it, we won't never let it go (Go) You better move yourself cause tomorrow's ass can wait There is no time, to sit there and procrastinate (you better)",2725,en,

[Chorus 3: Eminem] I done said a lotta things in my day, I admit it This is payback in a way, I regret it that I did it I done won a couple Grammys, but I sold my soul to get 'em Wasn't in it for the trophies, just the fuckin' recognition Fuck's the difference? I'm that cracker, bend the law, fuck the rules Man I used to risk it all, now I got too much to lose I've been eatin' long enough, man my stomach should be full I just ate, licked the plate, my buffet, lucky me Fuck you think? (Woo!). [Verse 2: Eminem] I got a couple of mansions Still I don't have any manners You got a couple of ghost writers But to these kids it don't actually matter They're askin' me, ""What the fuck happened to hip-hop?"" I said, ""I don't have any answers"" 'Cause I took an L when I dropped my last album It hurt me like hell but I'm back on these rappers And actually comin' from humble beginnings I'm somewhat uncomfortable winning I wish I could say, ""What a wonderful feeling!"" ""We're on the upswing like we're punchin' the ceiling!"" But nothin' is feeling like anyone has any fuckin' ability To even stick to a subject, it's killin' me The inability to pen humility Ha-ta-ta ba-ta-ta, why don't we make a bunch of Fuckin' songs about nothin' and mumble 'em? Fuck it, I'm goin' for the jugular Shit is a circus, you clowns that are comin' up Don't give an ounce of a motherfuck About the ones that were here before you that made rap Let's recap, way back, MC's that wreak havoc on tape decks ADAT's, where the G Raps and Kanes at? We need 3 Stacks ASAP and bring Masta Ace back 'Cause half of these rappers have brain damage All the lean rappin', face tats, syruped out like tree sap I don't hate trap, and I don't wanna seem mad But in fact, where the old me at? The same cat That would take that feedback and aim back, I need that But I think it's inevitable They know what button to press or what lever to pull To get me to snap though (Lil' bitch) And if I pay it attention I'm probably makin' it bigger But you've been takin' ya dicks in the fuckin' back, ho (Get it?) On the brink, any minute got me thinkin' of finishin' Everything with acetaminophen and reapin' the benefits I'm asleep at the wheel again As I peak into thinkin' about an evil intent Of another beat I'ma kill again 'Cause even if I gotta end up eatin' a pill again Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin It better be at least 70 to 300 milligram And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again Levels to this shit, I got an elevator You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker I sound like a broken record every time I break a record Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way I got spite inside my DNA But I wrote 'til the wheels fall off, I'm workin' tirelessly, ayy It's the moment y'all been waitin' for Like California wishin' rain to pour In that drought, y'all been prayin' for My downfall from the 8 Mile to the Southpaw Still the same Marshall, that outlaw That they say as a writer might've fell off I'm back on that bull like the cowboy. [Chorus 2: Joyner Lucas & Eminem] So y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move (Yeah), y'all gotta move Give me some room, give me some room, give me the juice Hop out the coupe, hop out the coupe, hop out and shoot Y'all gotta move, y'all gotta move, give me the juice",5965,en,

Maxine: I don't know, thinking about something freaky to do. Verse 1: Eminem I know this crack fiend Maxine who needs a vaccine She tests positive but tells you that her act's clean Plus she got a sugar daddy Asking every hooker that he takes in to crook her badly If you mistook her sadly, on her reputation You're in jepordation, if you ain't got no preparation When you step away son, she got her face done Looking provocative, she'll let you knock it if You press the issue and get undressed to kiss you If you match the price, otherwise she won't look at you twice But when you catch the lice, or get the urgency To go to the emergency cause it burns to pee Don't bring your germs to me, cause I ain't trying to hear it While your fighting you fucking disease trying to clear it (Maxine!). Verse 2: Denaun Porter Sometimes I wonder, what's your purpose? In life that is To get with every brother and unveil one of his kids, shit You living trife, got three kids at home and club hopping every night You say it's gonna stop but it. just. slows. down And then speeds back to a regular pace, there is no end to this Mystery, whatever your reason even is to be You say you wanna be with me, but how can you say that When you got niggas hiding in your closet I refrain from getting angry but you keep on that strangely. Verse 3: 3 I met this girl last week, she was a freak, and she liked me So I stepped on it and then asked my homies And chilled on the side and then watched they niggas Big game over there and take notes, while I get this number I stepped to her first I cleared my throat and said ""Hey Bitch. Haven't I seen you before?"", looked at my nigga Turned around and got slapped throughout my hands And said ""Oh it's like that?"" She said she just broke up with her nigga and shit She started crying, and asked me to forgive her and shit She said her name was Maxine, so I told her I wanted her number She asked could I give her mine two Got to the crib and called her up We got into a good conversation that's when she asked me could I fuck I said ""Maxine check this out, Give me your address I'll be through and you'll find out"" Got to the crib she let me in She didn't waste time she grabbed my hand and proceeded to the bedroom I said ""Hold up, and stop proceeding, you rushing things"" What the fuck are you doing? So I went for my protection, took off my clothes and started flexing As she went for my midsection I threw her down as I tore off her shirt Pulled out my jimmy and I thought about putting in work Before I hit it she said ""3 don't get mad but there's something that I gotta tell your ass"" I said ""What is it, another nigga? It's ok"" She said ""No I forgot to tell you, that I got AIDS"" I got up out. Denaun: Hey, Maxine Maxine: What Denaun: You thinking about sucking my dick?

Music Box,https://www.metrolyrics.com/music-box-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"Yo Yeah girl Can you hear that It's playing our song Are you sleepy Take a nap. You're not afraid, of the dark, are ya. You hear the beat As it makes ya Not want to go to sleep. I knock on Dakota's door. It's locked so I go to creep. 'Round the back with binoculars. Not 'cause I want to peep But because I'm hungry She smells like taco's I want to eat Visions of hot chocolaty marshmallows Also sweet With sugar plums Oh look, here comes Marshall he's on your street He's placing hot smoldering charcoals beneath your feet Now walk on 'em He's dancing with carcasses cheek to cheek. Like a Thanksgiving turkey. A holiday ham See 'em sprinkled on toast With strawberry marmalade jam. Flavor my favorite graham crackers. With Jon Benet Rams I guess a modern day jack the ripper Is all that I am My music box When the lights are off. I see the girl's asleep But I'm waiting my love Keep calling me We're worlds apart But you mean the world to me I almost look comatose Who wants to be sober? gross I foam like a doberman Mouth open I overdose Put coke up my nostrils In both my holes then i plug my nose My pupils quadruple in size My eyes are so bugged I know. I put on my mother's make up. Get naked and run around Waving the gun around I think I'm down to a hundred pounds There's thunder, I wonder How come it rains but the sun is out?. The Devil's upset with his wife. They must be sluggin' it out. I must be buggin' the fuck out What the fuck I'm 'bout? Voices are leading me up to the attic. I love my house. They pull and they tug my blouse. The sound of a music box. Comes from inside a toy chest But what do I do it's locked? I pick it and open it But it's stuffed full of human parts I dig 'till I find it, I wind it up And the tune it starts. It's playing a song. So beautiful and the room is dark The moon is full I smell a funeral guess I'll loom in the park My music box When the lights are off I see the girl's asleep But I'm waiting my love Keep calling me We're worlds apart But you mean the world to me I'm fixated On asphyxiating And breakin' this little chick's neck Like a pixie stick The sick, satan worshippin' Bitches get horse whippin' I'm in the back Through the back Door slippin' Through the crack Leavin' the corpse drippin' The mortician of love Sent from above Forced and treat 'em all When she no more stingy I've become Been doing this for more than a quarter century I'm just numb Am I dreamin'? is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns The time has come To tie her up Dada roll me the ladder I've had enough of the chatter Climb up to the window look at her The crime is slow to shatter Her brain matter and batter her With a bat a matter of fact That will splatter her But before i do that I'll have a chat to flatter her Give her two compliments back to back Like Tabitha I'm your secret admirer I'm back to ravish ya So strong is your fight But you're no match for Dracula Prolonging her plight As I go back to stabbin' her Dismember her limbs Simple as that cadaver her Zoom in with the lens Then pan back the camera Stand back 'cause here comes your man Jack So Pamela My music box",3120,en,

You can kiss my indecisive ass crack maggots and the crackers ass Little cracker jack beat making wack math Backwards producers, I'm back bastards One more CD and then I'm packing up my bags and as I'm leaving I'll guarantee they scream 'Dre, don't leave us like that man' cause I'm about to lose my mind You've been gone for so long I'm running out of time.

Need Me,https://www.metrolyrics.com/need-me-lyrics-eminem.html,eminem,"You're drunk, the coffee is burned I hate to find you like this I always find you like this I come home and clean up your mess What would you do without that Why do I always come back Oh What I wouldn't do for you. And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me Maybe you need me Maybe you need me And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me Maybe you need me. Maybe you need me. Some nights I wanna run for the hills It's never easy with you I cannot reason with you But your smile as rare as it comes. What would I do without that Maybe that's why I come back. Oh What I wouldn't do for you. And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me Maybe you need me Maybe you need me. And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me Maybe you need me Maybe you need me. Starting to think we were made for each other But one of us in this relationship is raising the other You remind me of mother We drive one another as crazy as each other And we're both adults so there's no excuse for the games we play with each other Where you at? At a friends? No you ain't, motherfucker But I give her the benefit of the doubt Whenever the doubt kicks in, shiver When I touch her, cause I love her so much, I'm a sucker How her bottom lip can quiver when she's in trouble, she's in hot water Think I caught her cheating again Give her another chance? Another one after that? I'm swimming in that Egyptian River cause I'm in denial Say I don't need shit, but I have a shit-eating grin when I smile Making an excuse for us to act it out She's just acting out, with her inner child Then I set the truth on fire Cause I'd rather believe a lie then breathe a sigh of relieve that I don't believe in Going to bed mad I keep on trying to make a bad girl good But have a nice goodbye, you in good times In bed, I'm starting to feel like you're god damn dead Cause I literally feel like you could die of a ""should I?"" Leave me for good? You never would Never understood why they call it goodbye But I think I'm a pretty damn good guy And I think you're a good person, too I can save you, I can make you change But I keep putting my fuckin foot in my mouth Every time I gotta come and bail you out of the trouble you get yourself in I miss trouble but I can't leave I'd never sell you out I'd never turn my back on you. What the fuck is that? I'm co-dependant I'm just now noticing it But how every time I go to end it I don't have the cahoney's to do it. Nor the heart, uh, department store You're using my heart for a dart board But God must've had a non-stop score cause somebody paired us up But people say he ain't capable of making a mistake But this one's perfect. And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me Maybe you need me Maybe you need me And I'm starting to think that maybe you need me Maybe you need me Maybe you need me.

That's why my bars are full of broken bottles And my night stands are full of open Bibles. I think about more than I forget But I don't go around fire expecting not to sweat. And these niggas know I lay them down, make your bed Bitches try to kick me while I'm down: I'll break your leg. Money outweighing problems on the triple beam I'm sticking to the script, you niggas skipping scenes. Be good or be good at it Fucking right I've got my gun, semi-Cartermatic. Yeah, put a dick in their mouth, so I guess it's ""fuck what they say"". I'm high as a bitch: up, up and away Man, I come down in a couple of days. OK, you want me up in the cage, then I'll come out in beast mode. I got this world stuck in the safe, combination is the G-code. It's Weezy motherfucker, blood gang and I'm in bleed mode. All about my dough but I don't even check the peephole. So you can keep knocking but won't knock me down. No love lost, no love found It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now. You kicked me when I was down. But what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more). That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you Bitch you get (no love).

They say the competition is stiff But I get a hard dick from this shit,. now stick it in I ain't never giving in again. Caution to the wind, complete freedom. Look at these rappers, how I treat them So why the fuck would I join them when I beat 'em. They call me a freak cuz I like to spit on these pussies 'fore I eat them. Man get these whack cocksuckers off stage. Where the fuck is Kanye when you need him?. Snatch the mic from him, bitch I'mma let you finish in a minute. Yeah the rap is tight But I'm 'bout to spit the greatest verse of all time So you might want to go back to the lab tonight and um. Scribble out them rhymes you were going to spit. And start over from scratch and write new ones But I'm afraid that it ain't gonna make no difference. When I rip this stage and tear it in half tonight It's an adrenaline rush to feel the bass thump In the place all the way to the parking lot, fellow. Set fire to the mic and ignite the crowd You can see the sparks from hot metal. Cold-hearted from the day I Bogarted the game I so started to rock fellow. When I'm not even in my harshest You can still get roasted because Marsh is not mellow. Til I'm toppling from the top I'm not going to stop. I'm standing on my Monopoly board That means I'm on top of my game and it don't stop 'Til my hip don't hop anymore (shit). When you so good that you can't say it Because it ain't even cool for you to sound cocky anymore. People just get sick cause you spit. These fools can't drool or dribble a drop anymore And you can never break my stride. You never slow the momentum at any moment I'm about to blow. You'll never take my pride Killing the flow, slow venom and the opponent. Is getting no mercy, mark my words Ain't letting up, relentless. I smell blood, I don't give a fuck Keep giving them hell. Where was you when I fell and needed help up? You get no love. It's a little too late to say that you're sorry now You kicked me when I was down. But what you say, just (don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more). That's right bitch: and I don't need you, don't want to see you. Bitch you get (no love) You show me nothing but hate.

I may have hit you three times, I'm startin' to lose count But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refuse counsellin' This house is too huge, if you move out I'll burn all two thousand Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it 'Cause with you I'm in my fuckin' mind, without you I'm out it.

Remember the doubt By which I now stand. You write the book On the way it all ends.. Tear down Those mighty walls. Reinvent The way you talk..

Finally taking flight I know you don't think it's right I know that you think it's fake Maybe fake's what I like. The point is I have the right I'm thinking in black and white I'm thinking it's worth the fight Soon to be out of sight. Knowing it all this time Going with what I always longed for.
